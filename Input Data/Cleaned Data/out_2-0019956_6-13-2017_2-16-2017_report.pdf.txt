Objectives The objectives the Plan were assess the vertical and horizontal extent PCBs soil remove impacted from the site meet requirements assess the need assess groundwater quality stabilize site conditions necessary and assess site conditions during and the completion response activities determine the need conduct further response actions.  Groundwater Sampling and Analysis Subsequent the excavation the concrete pads and soil relatively thin layer groundwater accumulated portion the exaction located south the concrete pad that supported the transformer evaluate groundwater for impact installed inch diameter polyvinyl chloride pipe monitoring well this location Figures and December collected groundwater sample from this well using peristaltic pump and low flow methodology revised .  Method risk characterization can also used for soil and groundwater can used for soil and groundwater but also can used assess other media such indoor air surface water and sediments for which Method Under the Substantial Release Migration defined the presence one more the following conditions disposal site Releases that have resulted the discharge separate phase oil and separate phase hazardous material surface waters buildings underground utilities conduits Releases the ground surface vadose zone that not promptly removed contained are likely significantly impact the underlying groundwater significantly exacerbate existing condition groundwater pollution Releases groundwater that have migrated area expected migrate more than feet per year Releases the groundwater that have been are within one year likely detected public private drinking water well Releases the groundwater that have been are within one year likely detected surface water body wetland public water supply reservoir Releases the groundwater the vadose zone that have resulted have the potential result the discharge vapors into School Daycare Child Care Center occupied residential dwelling.  This Risk Characterization evaluates residual soil and groundwater impacts the Site property that are associated with historic releases free phase hydraulic oil [Release Tracking ] that was observed multiple sump collection basins located within the site building.  EnviroRisk Solutions Complex Sites Resourceful Solutions CUsersMarieDocumentsMarie workCJWClintonindust facilityClinton risk characterization final.docx Page Background This Method Human Health and Environmental Risk Characterization addresses soil and groundwater impact associated with residual contamination from releases hydraulic oil and PCBs Clinton Massachusetts.  Approach Method approach characterize risk was selected for the Site because the impacts soil and groundwater the Site warranted Site specific evaluation.  Residual impacts hydraulic oil groundwater are extremely limited and were detected few monitoring wells located the building slab the manufacturing facility PCBs were detected groundwater collected from the Site.  Since the residual soil and groundwater impacts associated with the hydraulic oil are located under the building slab assuming residents would exposed hydraulic oil impacted soil from the Site extremely conservative.  Based the concentrations constituents detected Site groundwater the potential for the Site impact the assumed downgradient surface water body Rigby Brook was determined negligible.  The establishes categories groundwater and soil for use the characterization risk posed contamination site.  forearms hands Sheet Exp Construction Worker Groundwater Table Chemical Specific Data Oral Subchronic Subchronic Oil RAFc derm Oral RfD RAFnc derm Hazardous Material day day Benzoaanthracene Benzoapyrene Benzobfluoranthene Benzog iperylene Benzokfluoranthene Chrysene Fluoranthene Naphthalene Phenanthrene Pyrene Arsenic Nickel Zinc Sheet Chem Attachment Best Management Practices Attachment Best Management Practices for Non commercial Gardening Disposal Sites This property part disposal site that has been assessed and determined meet the requirements Permanent Solution with Conditions under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan where the Conditions include the recommendation Best Management Practices BMPs for gardening reduce the potential risks from exposure contaminated soil that remains the site.  There was also single detection naphthalene groundwater sample collected from fractions PAHs were detected concentrations exceeding the Method groundwater standards.  separate Method Risk Characterization EnviroRisk was performed for the eastern portion the property related elevated detections zinc soil and groundwater part the public welfare evaluation Site soil and groundwater EPCs were compared UCLs shown Tables and respectively soil groundwater EPCs exceeded UCLs.
