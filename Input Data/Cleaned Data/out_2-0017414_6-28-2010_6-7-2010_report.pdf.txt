The purpose the monitoring well installation was assess potential impacts soil and groundwater result the failed sump discussed above July prior collecting groundwater samples developed monitoring wells and which were installed June July gauged and sampled groundwater from monitoring wells through .  Please refer the historical groundwater sampling table Table effort further delineate soil and groundwater impacts September oversaw the advancement three monitoring wells through October gauged the six site wells and collected groundwater samples from monitoring wells through should noted that groundwater sample was not collected from monitoring well based the presence .  Samples were submitted for analysis and analytical results indicated groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells and exceeded the applicable standards for one more constituents effort further delineate soil and groundwater impacts and evaluate potential condition Substantial Release Migration April oversaw the advancement four monitoring wells through April prior collecting groundwater samples developed monitoring wells and which were installed April addition well development and groundwater sampling personnel surveyed the four new monitoring wells using monitoring well known elevation tie into the survey previously conducted the site April gauged and sampled groundwater from monitoring wells through .  The April groundwater elevation and flow direction depicted Figure Groundwater Topography Map indicated the February Phase Report and based the recent groundwater and soil analytical results collected soil and groundwater impacts the site are currently above the applicable Method Standards addition based the proximity the nearest surface water body Lake Whalom located approximately the site and that the furthest downgradient wells and are below applicable groundwater standards AECOMs opinion that groundwater can ruled out potential discharge surface water .  Based several air screening JNort Leominster NEWReportsIRACIRAC final.docx events discussed above these screening events ultimately dismiss vapor intrusion standards within feet from occupied building based the lack vapors detected during the air screening events September personnel performed soil gas survey adjacent the southern wall the facility building order evaluate the potential for impacts indoor air.  Please refer Figure for the location the soil gas points April personnel installed permanent soil gas point and performed soil gas survey adjacent the southern wall the facility building order evaluate the potential for impacts indoor air.  Substantial Hazard Evaluation Based the recent soil gas air screening events three total indicating that direct exposure pathway currently does not exist from the soil gas points the inside ambient air complete exposure pathways risks human health safety public welfare and the environment currently exist with respect the site effort evaluate the potential for indoor air impacts performed soil gas survey adjacent the southern wall the facility building order evaluate the potential for indoor air impacts.  The granted verbal approval perform cleanup activities investigation and evaluation including removal product from the sump assessment impact the environment indoor air and repair the leak..  Implementation this acted accelerated response action prevent eliminate and minimize damage health safety public welfare the environment which may result from the contamination identified the site.  Samples were submitted for analysis and analytical results indicated groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells and exceeded the applicable standards for one more constituents and well was below the applicable standard.  Samples were submitted for analysis and analytical results indicated groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells and exceeded the applicable standards for one more constituents.
