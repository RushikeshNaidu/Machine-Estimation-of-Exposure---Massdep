Because the headspace screening results showed decreasing trend with increasing depth and because there was evidence contamination below depth six feet groundwater was not likely impacted the diesel fuel release associated .  Therefore since groundwater was determined not impacted the release groundwater monitoring wells were not installed and groundwater samples were not collected from any the borings.  Releases the ground surface the vadose zone that not promptly removed contained are likely significantly impact the underlying groundwater significantly exacerbate existing condition groundwater pollution.  All impacted soil was excavated and removed from retention pond and groundwater was not encountered the bottoms the excavations.  Release the groundwater the vadose zone that have resulted have the potential result the discharge vapors into school daycare child care center occupied residential dwelling schools daycares child care centers residential dwellings are located the vicinity the Site and groundwater was not impacted from the release associated .  Since the headspace readings and soil laboratory analytical results both locations showed indications soil impacts the vadose zone above the water table the release did not migrate groundwater and groundwater was therefore not evaluated.  There are potential groundwater exposure pathways for these receptors groundwater was not impacted and not used for drinking water the vicinity the Site.  Additionally based the depth groundwater feet bgs the locomotive release area and the average burial depth underground utilities approximately feet bgs utility and construction workers are not likely come into contact with groundwater beneath the Site which was not impacted from the release associated .  There are Contaminants Concern for groundwater the Site groundwater was not impacted discussed Section groundwater categorized based its potential for human consumption act source VOCs inhalation indoor air and affect the aquatic environment after discharge surface water.  All groundwater considered potential source discharge surface water and therefore classified addition groundwater was not impacted the release associated .  The nearest surface water body located approximately feet north the Site and groundwater was not affected the release associated the locomotive release area samples were collected evaluate the horizontal and vertical extents contamination and confirm that groundwater was not impacted Amec Foster Wheeler Project Number Number Immediate Response Action Completion Report and Permanent Solution Statement With Conditions Intermodal Terminal Worcester Massachusetts Release Tracking Page Page ................................................................................................................  Groundwater Groundwater was not affected the release soil impacts did not extend past six feet bgs the locomotive release and the water table located depth approximately feet bgs.  Temporal Distribution Samples Groundwater was not impacted from this release.  Groundwater was not affected the release soil impacts did not extend past six feet bgs and the locomotive release area the water table located depth approximately feet bgs.  does not exist for the ingestion dermal absorption inhalation from drinking water supply well because the Site not located Current Potential Drinking Water Source Area nor are there any private water supply wells located the vicinity the Site addition public private water supply wells are located the vicinity the Site Imminent Hazard does not exist the Site for the following reasons The release did not result the presence vapors within buildings structures underground utility conduits concentration equal greater than the Lower Explosive Limit The release did not endanger public safety within roadway The release did not pose significant risk human health when present the Site for short period time The release did not represent condition that was reactive explosive and did not threaten human health safety The release did not produce immediate acute adverse impacts freshwater saltwater fish populations The release did not produce readily apparent effects human health including respiratory distress dermal irritation private drinking water supply wells are located within feet the Site therefore highly unlikely that the release would impact private drinking water supply well concentrations ten times the Reportable Concentration The diesel impacted soil the area the release covered with stone ballast and not readily accessible and The release did not represent long term risk levels associated with current exposures that are greater than ten times the Cumulative Receptor Risk Limits .  Based the information obtained from the December subsurface investigation groundwater was not affected the release.  All groundwater considered potential source discharge surface water and classified was off loaded into the facilitys groundwater treatment system located next the oil water separator December Amec Foster Wheeler conducted subsurface investigation south track between tracks and consisting the advancement five soil borings through delineate the extent the diesel fuel release and determine diesel fuel had migrated and affected groundwater.  Since groundwater the locomotive release area located depth approximately feet bgs the location the locomotive release area was not likely affected the release associated .  Therefore groundwater the retention pond area was not likely affected the release associated .  The depth the water table below the bottom retention pond unknown however the retention pond was dry during soil excavation activities and groundwater was not encountered after excavation activities were completed the lowest areas the pond consisting the areas located east and west the gate valves well the culvert area addition groundwater was not affected the release.  The Method risk characterization compares contaminant concentrations detected the Site promulgated lists soil and groundwater standards was performed manner consistent with scientifically acceptable risk assessment practices and MassDEP guidance and was appropriate evaluate risk harm health safety public welfare and the environment the Site for the following reasons Soil was determined the only affected media There potential for volatilization indoor air There are analytes which bioaccumulate within the top two feet soil and There was non aqueous phase liquid detected soil groundwater the Site.  Immediate Response Action Completion Report and Permanent Solution Statement With Conditions Intermodal Terminal Worcester Massachusetts Release Tracking Page The characterization risk harm health safety public welfare and the environment required the Site because the contamination soil has not been reduced background levels described the .  There are private potable wells located within the vicinity the Site accordance with and Permanent Solution Statement with Conditions applies the Disposal Site since level Significant Risk exists has been achieved All sources oil and hazardous materials have been eliminated controlled The level the environment has been reduced close background levels feasible Concentrations not exceed the applicable Upper Concentration Limits UCLs Maintaining level Significant Risk will not require Activity and Use Limitation and Limitations conditions the Permanent Solution apply because residential Method standards for future unrestrictive use were not achieved for one volatile petroleum hydrocarbon fraction and the Site located within railroad right way.
