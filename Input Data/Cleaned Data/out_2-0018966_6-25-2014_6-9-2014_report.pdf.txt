The soil vapor monitoring points are located south and southwest the Site building and downgradient with respect groundwater flow direction from the source area Releases the ground surface the vadose zone that not promptly removed contained are likely significantly impact the underlying groundwater significantly exacerbate existing condition groundwater pollution Contamination has not been observed migrate any distance greater than that observed soon after the release was identified and the contaminant plume naturally attenuating over time.  Due the fate and transport mechanisms and the observed contaminant distribution and the source removal performed the current condition release not expected significantly further impact the underlying groundwater significantly exacerbate existing groundwater pollution.  Leominster Releases the groundwater that have migrated are expected migrate more than feet per year Based recent and historical investigations and laboratory analytical results for groundwater the contaminant plume limited size and has remained stable such impacts groundwater are not expected migrate more than feet per year Releases the groundwater that have been are within one year likely detected public private water supply well The Site and surrounding area are not supplied municipal drinking water Releases the groundwater that have been are within one year likely detected surface water body wetland public water supply reservoir public supply reservoirs are located the immediate Site vicinity Releases the groundwater the vadose zone that have resulted are within one year likely result the discharge vapors into school buildings occupied residential dwellingss Groundwater from all Site monitoring wells that remains above the Method standards localized the former area the system and thus does not represent potential source vapors indoor air nearby structures discussed Section Site soil gas points were screened during the groundwater sampling event.  Soil Vapor Point Monitoring Soil gas samples from the Site related vapor monitoring points and were field screened March evaluate the potential for the soil gas result indoor air impact.  Twenty nine residential properties have been identified within feet the Site indicated the following releases shall deemed pose release the environment which results the presence within buildings structures underground utility conduits concentration equal greater than the lower explosive limit release the environment reactive explosive hazardous material described which threatens human health safety release roadway that endangers public safety release the environment which poses significant risk human health when present for even short period time specified release the environment which produces immediate acute adverse impacts freshwater saltwater populations release the environment which produces readily apparent effects human health including respiratory distress dermal irritation.  MassDEP verbally approved the continuation removal activities well assessment activities which included the following Assess for critical exposure pathways CEPs nearby underground utilities for gasoline and vapors associated with this release Post system excavation soil sampling Remove canopy and kiosk and Excavate cubic yards petroleum impacted soil necessary..
