Soil under the building floor slab currently inaccessible and groundwater under and the rear the building were determined have been impacted lesser quantities and very minor amounts cis dichloroethylene.  Note that the groundwater containing the Lower Plaza property not the focus the although portion the Lower Plaza property has been impacted the release Duds Upper Plaza.  was utilized for groundwater sampling analysis and Method was used analyze all air based samples such soil vapor and indoor air noted Table groundwater sampling indicated that concentrations above the applicable Method groundwater standards are present monitoring wells the Upper and Lower Plaza properties and April significantly impacted well being concentration micrograms per liter measured December which located immediately adjacent and down gradient Duds.  The objective the remove VOCs that were identified during the investigations performed EnChem and historical site investigations performed and from indoor air impacted unsaturated zone soil and groundwater located beneath the spaces.  This plan includes provisions for additional remediation soil and groundwater that will performed via situ chemical oxidation using EnChems patented OxyZone Process Patent Situ Chemical Oxidation Historic soil data obtained beneath the floor slab Duds and Supercuts current groundwater data current soil vapor sampling screening data and current indoor air data indicate that significant release has impacted soil from immediately below the floor slab Duds the water table depth approximately feet under the floor slab.  Monitoring Well Installation additional monitoring wells will installed the Upper and Lower Plaza more accurately determine the current nature and extent impacts groundwater associate with this release.  However given the significant concentrations VOCs being recovered the system activities remain necessary continue mitigate the potential for impacts indoor air.  Per the request indoor air sample was collected from within Middlesex Savings Bank located across driveway adjacent Supercuts and Landos sub shop and pizzeria July analytes were detected the indoor air sample indicating that the Bank has not likely been significantly affected this release July indoor air sample was collected from the rear Duds August one week after commencement system operations indoor air samples were collected from Supercuts the front and rear Duds Landos and Dunkin Donuts.  Additional assessment via the installation new monitoring wells and soil gas sampling points will performed needed and required accordance with the fully define the nature and extent contamination both the Upper and Lower Plaza properties.
