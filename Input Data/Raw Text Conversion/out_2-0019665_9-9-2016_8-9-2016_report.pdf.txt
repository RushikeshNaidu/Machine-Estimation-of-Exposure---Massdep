1.0 INTRODUCTION 

CMG Environmental, Inc. (CMG) has prepared this Immediate Response Action (IRA) Status 
Report for the property located at 18 Hammond Street in Oxford, Massachusetts (the Site). 
Figure 1 (Site Location Map) depicts the Site in relation to streets and other topographic 
features. 

This IRA Status Report addresses release tracking number (RTN) 2-19665. CMG followed 
regulations set forth by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in the 
Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP, 310 CMR 40.0000) in preparing this IRA Status Report. 

1.1 PURPOSE 
The purpose of an IRA is to address urgent releases or threats of release at a ‘disposal site’1 that 
trigger two-hour notifications pursuant to 310 CMR 40.0311 or 40.0312, or 72-hour notifications 
per 40.0313 or 40.0314. This includes disposal sites where a Condition of Substantial Release 
Migration (SRM)2 exists. 

The purpose of an IRA Status Report is to document IRA activities completed since submittal of 
the last IRA Report (in this case, the February 5, 2016 Initial IRA Status Report), in accordance 
with 310 CMR 40.0425. 

1.2 SITE LOCATION & IDENTIFICATION 
The Site is located at 18 Hammond Street, Oxford MA 01540. It is on the northeasterly side of 
Hammond Street, approximately 350' east of its intersection with Foster Street. The Site is at 
42º08'03" north latitude (42.13413 °N), 71º52'08" west longitude (-71.86890 °E). The UTM 
(Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates in the middle of the Site are 4,668,650 meters north 
and 262,890 meters east in Zone 19.  

Oxford Assessor’s Map 32A identifies the Site as Lot D29, which consists of 13,940 square feet 
(approximately 0.32 acres) of land. Figure 2 (Property Overview) shows the property in relation 

                                                 
1 Defined at 310 CMR 40.0006 as “any structure, well, pit, pond, lagoon, impoundment, ditch, landfill or other 
place or area, excluding ambient air or surface water, where uncontrolled oil and/or hazardous material [OHM] has 
come to be located as a result of any spilling, leaking, pouring, abandoning, emitting, emptying, discharging, 
injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, discarding or otherwise disposing of such [OHM].” 
2 Defined at 310 CMR 40.0006 as “a 72-hour notification condition at a disposal site that is further defined at 310 
CMR 40.0313(4) and includes any of the following: 

(a) releases that have resulted in the discharge of separate-phase oil and/or separate-phase hazardous material to 
surface waters, subsurface structures, or underground utilities or conduits; 
(b) releases to the ground surface or to the vadose zone that, if not promptly removed or contained, are likely to 
significantly impact the underlying groundwater, or significantly exacerbate an existing condition of ground-
water pollution; 
(c) releases to the groundwater that have migrated or are expected to migrate more than 200 feet per year; 
(d) releases to the groundwater that have been or are within one year likely to be detected in a public or private 
water supply well; 
(e) releases to the groundwater that have been or are within one year likely to be detected in a surface water 
body, wetland, or public water supply reservoir; or 
(f) releases to the groundwater that have resulted or have the potential to result in the discharge of vapors into a 
School, Daycare or Child Care Center or occupied Residential Dwelling.”

to abutting parcels and other geographic features. Figure 3 (Site Plan) depicts the limits of the 
RTN 2-19665 ‘disposal site’ in relation to Property boundaries and other features. 

1.3 CURRENT SITE OCCUPANT & USE 
A one-story single-family home has occupied the Site since circa 1960. The Property appears to 
have consisted of undeveloped land prior to that. 

1.4 RELEASE AT SITE 
According to the Site owner, Mr. Peter McCarthy, Peterson Oil Service (Peterson) of Worcester, 
Massachusetts filled a 275-gallon fuel oil aboveground storage tank (AST) located in the basement 
of the house in April 2015. The residents do not use the fuel oil during the warmer months. The 
occupant attempted to turn the heating system on in the fall of 2015 but it would not start. At 
approximately 5:00 p.m. on October 8, 2015, Peterson inspected the AST and found it to be empty.  

CMG identified two 72-hour reporting conditions at the Site:  

 Groundwater contamination in excess of RCGW-1 standards within 500' of 
private drinking water supply wells; and 

 Non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) >½" thick at a location >30' from an occupied 
residential dwelling. 

1.5 IRA APPROVAL 
At 5:40 p.m. on October 8, 2015 Mr. Howard Peterson of Peterson Oil Company verbally 
reported the two-hour release identified as RTN 2-19665 to DEP on behalf of Mr. McCarthy. On 
October 22, 2015, Mr. Robert Dunne of DEP granted verbal approval to excavate up to 50 cubic 
yards of contaminated soil and recover NAPL from Site groundwater. On November 16, 2015, 
DEP approved increasing the total amount of soil removal to 100 cubic yards. 

CMG prepared a written IRA Plan for RTN 2-19665, which Mr. McCarthy submitted via eDEP 
on December 4, 2015, that documented our approved verbal IRA Plan. CMG deemed this IRA 
Plan tacitly approved on December 25, 2015 following completion of the 21-day presumptive 
approval period set forth at 310 CMR 40.0420(9), since DEP did not issue any written denial of 
our plan during this interval.

1.7 PUBLIC NOTIFICATION [40.1403(3)(f) & 40.1406(3)] 
Appendix A presents copies of the notification letters CMG sent to abutting homeowners to satisfy 
MCP public involvement requirements regarding drinking water sampling (see Section 2.1.2).  

2.0 RESPONSE ACTION STATUS [40.0425] 

The MCP requires submittal of additional IRA Status Reports every six months following submittal 
of the first such report. CMG submitted the initial IRA Status Report on February 5, 2016. This 
report is the second IRA Status Report for RTN 2-19665. 

2.1 IRA ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED SINCE PREVIOUS STATUS REPORT [40.0425(3)(a)] 
2.1.1 GROUNDWATER SAMPLING & ANALYSIS 
On February 19 & May 26, 2016, CMG gauged depth to groundwater in Site monitoring wells MW-
1 through MW-8. We used low-flow sampling techniques to collect groundwater samples from 
MW-1 through MW-5 on February 19, and wells MW-1 through MW-5 & MW-8 on May 26, 2016. 
CMG submitted these samples to Eurofins Spectrum Analytical, Inc. (Spectrum) of Agawam, 
Massachusetts for analysis of volatile petroleum hydrocarbons (VPH) with target volatile organic 
compound (VOC) identifications and extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH) with target 
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) identifications. Table 2 (following the Figures) 
summarizes groundwater analytical results CMG has obtained so far at the Site. Appendix C 
includes Spectrum certificates of analysis and chain-of-custody documentation. 

Spectrum did not identify any of the tested parameters in either MW-2 or MW-3 above laboratory 
reporting limits. MW-1 exhibited low concentrations of xylenes on February 19 and EPH on 
February 19 & May 26, 2016, significantly below their applicable reportable concentrations.  

The analytical results do not indicate the presence of any of the tested parameters above 
laboratory reporting limits in the sample collected from MW-4 on February 19, 2016. However, 
on May 26, 2016, this well exhibited low concentrations of the VOCs benzene, naphthalene & 
xylenes and VPH concentrations, all at levels below the applicable reportable concentrations. 
The analysis of the sample from MW-8 collected on May 26, 2016 also indicated a concentration 
of VPH C9-C10 aromatics below the applicable reportable concentration.  

Monitoring well MW-5 was the only well with significant detections of multiple VOCs, VPH, 
and EPH. This well had concentrations of benzene and VPH C9-C10 aromatics above the 
reportable concentrations. Based on this information, CMG concludes that at least one more 
groundwater sampling event is necessary to demonstrate that groundwater contamination is 
naturally attenuating and approaching background conditions.  

CMG collected groundwater samples from monitoring wells MW-1, MW-4, MW-5, and MW-8 
on July 28, 2016. We submitted these samples to Spectrum for analysis of VPH and EPH; 
however, we did not receive laboratory analytical results for these samples prior to the date of 
this IRA Status Report. CMG will include analytical results in our next IRA Status Report. 

CMG inspected recovery wells RW-1 & RW-2 at the Site on May 26, 2016. Both recovery wells 
had absorbent pads; CMG observed brown staining on each pad and a sheen on the surface of the 
water in the wells. We did not note any petroleum odor.

2.1.2 DRINKING WATER SAMPLING & ANALYSIS 
On February 19, 2016, CMG collected tap samples from the kitchen sinks of both 10 Hammond 
Street and 22 Hammond Street. We removed the aerators and purged the taps for approximately 
15 minutes each prior to obtaining drinking water samples. CMG submitted these samples to 
Spectrum for analysis of VOCs via EPA Method 524.2, EPH, and PAHs. Table 3 summarizes 
drinking water analytical results CMG has obtained so far at the Site. Appendix C includes 
Spectrum certificates of analysis and chain-of-custody documentation. 

The laboratory results did not identify any parameters in the sample from 22 Hammond Street 
above laboratory reporting limits. The sample from 10 Hammond Street had low detections of 
VOCs chloroform and 1,1,1-trichlorethane (TCA). These concentrations are significantly below 
the DEP groundwater standards and the state and federal drinking water guidelines. The analysis 
did not identify any other concentrations above laboratory reporting limits in this sample. 

CMG sent letters to the homeowners on March 8, 2016 regarding the results of drinking water 
sampling, along with copies of the laboratory results and Forms BWSC 123 (Notice of 
Environmental Sampling) & BWSC 124 (Informational Notice about IRAs). Appendix A includes 
copies of these letters and forms. 

2.1.3 SURFACE WATER SAMPLING & ANALYSIS 
On May 26 & June 10, 2016, CMG collected surface water samples from the pond adjoining the 
Site. In May, the distance from MW-2 to the edge of sediment/surface water was 19' and from 
MW-3 it was 6.5'. CMG noted there was a layer of scum on the pond in May, the majority of 
which appeared to be pine pollen. In June, we noted that the pond water was much clearer than 
on the previous Site visit, with almost no pollen or algae on the water. CMG collected the June 
surface water sample from the same location at Carbuncle Pond (about halfway along the dock at 
the rear of 18 Hammond Street). We submitted both surface water samples to Spectrum for EPH 
analysis with target PAH identifications on each date. Table 4 summarizes surface water 
analytical results CMG has obtained so far at the Site. Appendix C includes Spectrum 
certificates of analysis and chain-of-custody documentation. 

CMG compared surface water analytical results to the DEP Ambient Water Quality Guide values 
and EPA Freshwater Ambient Water Quality Criteria. Laboratory analysis identified 173 µg/L 
EPH C19-C36 aliphatics and 171 µg/L EPH C11-C22 aromatics in the May sample. The only 
available guidance values for these EPH fractions are 2,100 µg/L for C19-C36 aliphatics (from the 
DEP Ambient Water Quality Guide) and 300 µg/L for C11-C22 aromatics (the marine acute 
screening value for total PAHs from the EPA Freshwater criteria). Therefore these detections are 
significantly below the existing guidance values. Spectrum did not detect any EPH or target 
PAH identifications in the June sample.  

When CMG received the analytical results from our May 26 sampling (on 6/10/16), we opined that 
the detection of EPH C19-C36 aliphatics & C11-C22 aromatics in surface water might possibly 
constitute a condition of SRM pursuant to 310 CMR 40.0313(4)(e), hence an additional 72-hour 
reporting condition associated with RTN 2-19665. Therefore we called the DEP Central Region 
Emergency Response Branch at 1:11 on June 10, 2016 and left a message for Mr. Jason Ward 
regarding the surface water analytical results. Mr. Ward called CMG back at 2:40 p.m. that same 
day after having discussed this result with other DEP staff. We agreed to conduct additional 



RTN 2-19665 IRA STATUS REPORT CMG ID 2015-120 
18 HAMMOND STREET, OXFORD MA AUGUST 2, 2016 

— PAGE 5 — 

testing to determine if the surface water results were reproducible (and if so, whether they were 
attributable to the RTN 2-19665 fuel oil release). 

CMG requested that Spectrum provide chromatograms of the May 26 surface water sample, 
chromatograms for the groundwater sample well collected from monitoring well MW-5 on May 
26 (Spectrum ID SC21910-05), and a reference chromatogram of No. 2 fuel oil for comparison. 
Appendix B includes copies of these chromatograms. Comparison of these chromatograms 
indicates there is no similarity between EPH detected in the May 26 surface water sample and 
EPH detected from the sampling of monitoring well MW-5 on the same date. Furthermore, the 
aliphatics fraction chromatograms for the May 26 surface water sample exhibits six significant 
peaks at regular intervals after 8½ minutes that are well beyond the retention time for the 
ordinary constituents of No. 2 fuel oil; CMG opines that these are high-molecular weight n-
alkanes associated with plant waxes. 

CMG concludes that EPH detections in the May 26, 2016 surface water sample we collected 
from Carbuncle Pond behind 18 Hammond Street are not related to the RTN 2-19665 fuel oil 
release, nor were they reproducible. CMG opines that the initial (5/26/16 sampling) EPH results 
were the result of pond scum, including a significant amount of pine pollen, inadvertently 
collected with the surface water sample. Therefore CMG concludes that EPH detections in the 
May 26 surface water sample do not constitute a 72-hour reporting condition associated with 
RTN 2-19665. No release retraction is necessary, since DEP (Jason Ward) neither opened a new 
RTN on June 10 due to CMG’s phone call, nor did he add our findings as an additional 
notification condition for RTN 2-19665 at that time. CMG summarized these activities in a letter 
dated July 6, 2016 to DEP. Appendix B includes a copy of the letter and DEP correspondence. 

2.1.4 SEDIMENT SAMPLING & ANALYSIS 
On May 26, 2016, CMG collected a sediment sample from the edge of the surface water and 
submitted it for EPH and PAH analysis. Spectrum did not identify any EPH or PAHs in this 
sample. Table 5 summarizes sediment analytical results CMG has obtained so far at the Site. 
Appendix C includes Spectrum certificates of analysis and chain-of-custody documentation. 

2.2 SIGNIFICANT NEW INFORMATION OR DATA [40.0425(3)(b)] 
CMG obtained the following significant new information or data: 

 Additional groundwater monitoring and sampling is necessary to achieve a 
Permanent Solution at the Site, 

 The RTN 2-19665 release has not significantly impacted drinking water at the 
Site or in the vicinity, and 

 The release has not significantly impacted surface water at Carbuncle Pond. 

2.3 REMEDIATION WASTE [40.0425(3)(c)] 
Mr. McCarthy has not generated any remediation waste related to RTN 2-19665 since the date of 
our IRA Plan; CMG does not anticipate generating any during the remaining course of this IRA. 

2.4 REMEDIATION SYSTEM MONITORING DATA [40.0425(3)(d)] 
CMG has not operated any remedial systems at the Site to date.

2.5 MITIGATION OF CRITICAL EXPOSURE PATHWAY [40.0425(5)] 
The MCP defines Critical Exposure Pathway (CEP) at 310 CMR 40.0006(12) as:  

… those routes by which [OHM] released at a disposal site are transported, or are likely to be 
transported, to human receptors via: 

(a) vapor-phase emissions of measurable concentrations of [OHM] into the living or working 
space of a pre-school, daycare, school or occupied residential dwelling; or 
(b) ingestion, dermal absorption or inhalation of measurable concentrations of [OHM] from 
drinking water supply wells located at and servicing a pre-school, daycare, school or occupied 
residential dwelling. 

DEP monitored indoor air in the residence at the time of the release (October 8, 2015) and did 
not detect any measurable vapor-phase emissions related to RTN 2-19665.  

CMG has obtained drinking water samples from three nearby private drinking water supply 
source to date. The only detections in drinking water were of chloroform, methyl tertiary butyl 
ether, tertiary amyl methyl ether, and TCA, all of which were at concentrations significantly 
below all established standards.  

Based on the above information, CMG has not identified evidence to suggest that a CEP exists 
as a result of the RTN 2-19665 release. However, we will attempt to sample drinking water at 3 
Chaffee Lane, the only adjoining property with a private water supply which CMG has not yet 
sampled, to confirm that the release has not impacted any drinking water supply wells. 

2.6 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION [40.0425(3)(d)] 
CMG is not aware of any other information requested by DEP regarding the IRA for RTN 2-19665. 

2.7 LICENSED SITE PROFESSIONAL (LSP) OPINION [40.0425(3)(e)] 
CMG prepared a Form BWSC105 [“Immediate Response Action (IRA) Transmittal Form”] using 
the eDEP electronic submittal system. Section E of this form presents the LSP Opinion regarding 
this IRA Status Report for RTN 2-19665. Section I of this form presents the certification 
required by 310 CMR 40.0425(3)(e). CMG has attached a .pdf copy of this IRA Status Report to 
the Form BWSC105 submitted electronically. 

3.0 LIMITATIONS & CONDITIONS 

3.1 METHODOLOGY

certification and eDEP submittal; and 

 Prepared this IRA Status Report. 

3.3 GENERAL LIMITATIONS 
CMG conducted IRA response actions in accordance with generally accepted engineering and 
hydrogeologic practices. CMG makes no other warranty, express or implied. CMG cannot 
provide absolute assurance that we have identified any and all recognized environmental 
conditions (including DEP reportable conditions) at the Site.  

Where CMG included visual or other observations in this report, they represent conditions 
visibly and/or physically observed at the time of the inspection, or verified through interviewing 
or by record review, and may not be indicative of past or future Site conditions. 

Please be advised that environmental conditions at the Site and surrounding properties may 
change in time. CMG does not render an opinion as to environmental Site conditions that change 
after the date of the environmental studies reported herein. 

3.4 SPECIFIC CONDITIONS OF THE IRA STATUS REPORT 
CMG based the conclusions of this report, in large part, on information provided by the client, 
their agents, or third parties, including state or local officials. CMG assumes no responsibility for 
the accuracy and completeness of this information. CMG based the conclusions discussed herein 
solely and in reliance upon information collected during activities detailed in our Scope of 
Services (see Section 3.2 above).

CMG’s subsurface investigation included the collection and laboratory analysis of soil, 
groundwater, and drinking water samples from a limited number of locations at the Site. 
However, CMG did not intend this study to be a definitive investigation of subsurface conditions 
at the Site. CMG restricted the scope of services for this investigation due to time and/or cost 
constraints, and though we did undertake a limited amount of analytical testing, currently 
unrecognized subsurface conditions may exist at the Site. Increasing exploration (such as 
placement of test pits, completion of additional soil borings with subsequent collection of soil 
samples for laboratory analysis, installation of additional groundwater monitoring wells with 
subsequent collection of groundwater samples for laboratory analysis, and conducting surface 
geophysical survey techniques) may better delineate subsurface conditions. 

CMG’s Site inspection included observing the Site and surrounding area. However not all Site 
boundaries were clearly delineated, making it difficult to distinguish certain Site features from 
those of the surrounding area. Therefore, the location of certain Site features described in this 
Report and depicted on the figures may be approximate. 

3.5 RELIANCE 
CMG prepared this IRA Plan for the sole use of Mr. McCarthy, his successors and assigns to 
address DEP reporting obligations regarding assessment and remediation activities associated 
with RTN 2-19665. CMG does not authorize use of this information by others for any reason, 
except with our prior written consent.

INFORMATIONAL NOTICE ABOUT IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACTIONS  
As required by 310 CMR 40.1403(11) of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan 

 
MASSACHUSETTS REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE THIS NOTICE  
This notice is being provided pursuant to the Massachusetts Contingency Plan and the notification 
requirement at 310 CMR 40.1403(11).  The Massachusetts Contingency Plan is a state regulation 
that specifies requirements for parties who are taking actions to address releases of chemicals (oil or 
hazardous material) to the environment.   
 
THE PERSON(S) PROVIDING THIS NOTICE 
This notice has been sent to you by the person who is addressing a release of oil or hazardous 
material to the environment at the location listed in Section A on the reverse side of this form. (The 
regulations refer to the area where the oil or hazardous material is present as the “disposal site”.)  
 
PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE 
Parties who are taking an Immediate Response Action to assess, and eliminate or mitigate conditions 
that could pose a risk to human health or safety or the environment, if unaddressed in the short-term, 
are required by state regulations to notify persons who are in close proximity to the area where the 
Immediate Response Action is occurring (i.e., “Affected Individuals”).  The purpose of the notice is to 
inform its recipient (identified in Section B on the reverse side of this notice) of the purpose, scope 
and nature of the Immediate Response Action and how to obtain more information.   
  
The regulations also required that the same “Affected Individuals” receive notice upon the completion

TERTIARY­AMYL METHYL ETHER (TAME)
CASRN: 994058

Update: April 2006

Current Massachusetts Regulatory Limit
ORSGL = 0.09 mg/L.

Federal Regulatory Limit
No MCL available

Basis for Criteria
The ORS guideline for TAME was derived based on the RfD (presented below) derived by ORS for this chemical and
assumes that a 70 kg adult ingests 2 L/day of drinking water. A relative source contribution factor of 20% and a relative
source contribution factor to account for potential carcinogenicity are incorporated into the final value.

RfD: 0.125 mg/kg/day (MassDEP, 2006)
UF: 1000 (10 = subchronic to chronic; 10 = interspecies; 10 = intraspecies)
MF: 1

Critical Effects
Exposure to high concentrations of TAME has produced effects on the central nervous system, liver and kidney. In a 28­
day subchronic oral study, 10 Sprague­Dawley rats per group were administered 125, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of TAME via
gavage 7 days per week for 28 days. Dose­related, statistically significant increases in adrenal and kidney weights were
seen at the 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day doses in male rats. ORS identified a NOAEL of 125 mg/kg/day from this study
(MassDEP, 2006).

Cancer Assessment: The U.S. EPA has not classified TAME under either the old U.S. EPA carcinogen classification
system or under their Proposed Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (U.S. EPA, 1999a). Using the 1999 proposed
guidelines, ORS would tentatively classify TAME as having suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity but not sufficient to
assess human carcinogenic potential.

Class
VOC

Analytical Information
PQL: 5 ug/L

Analytical Methods
U.S. EPA Method 8260 and 524.2

PQLs and analytical methods may have been updated since this guidance value was last revised. Updated analytical
methods for drinking water and their associated PQLs may be found at US EPA Drinking Water Analytical Methods .

Other Regulatory Data
Any Health Advisories, Reference Doses (RfDs), cancer assessments or Cancer Potency Factors (CPFs) referenced in
this document pertain to the derivation of the current guidance value. Updated information may be obtained from the
following sources:

Health Advisories ­ The U.S. EPA provides guidance for shorter­term exposures for chemicals based on their non­cancer
effects. Current health advisories may be more current than those used to derive MCLs and may be found at US EPA
Current Drinking Water Health Advisories .

RfDs, cancer assessments and CPFs ­ For specific information pertaining to derivation of drinking water criteria, consult
the Federal Register notice that announces the availability of the most current guidance for that chemical. In addition,
information on other current RfDs and CPFs as well as cancer assessments for specific chemicals may be found in the
U.S. EPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) at http://www.epa.gov/iris/. Please note that the information in IRIS

CASE NARRATIVE:

Data has been reported to the RDL.  This report excludes estimated concentrations detected below the RDL and above the MDL 

(J-Flag).

All non-detects and all results below the reporting limit are reported as < (less than) the reporting limit in this report.

The samples were received 4.1 degrees Celsius, please refer to the Chain of Custody for details specific to temperature upon receipt.  

An infrared thermometer with a tolerance of +/- 1.0 degrees Celsius was used immediately upon receipt of the samples.

If a Matrix Spike (MS), Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) or Duplicate (DUP) was not requested on the Chain of Custody, method 

criteria may have been fulfilled with a source sample not of this Sample Delivery Group.

MADEP has published a list of analytical methods (CAM) which provides a series of recommended protocols for the acquisition, 

analysis and reporting of analytical data in support of MCP decisions.  "Presumptive Certainty" can be established only for those 

methods published by the MADEP in the MCP CAM.  The compounds and/or elements reported were specifically requested by the 

client on the Chain of Custody and in some cases may not include the full analyte list as defined in the method.  Regulatory limits may 

not be achieved if specific method and/or technique was not requested on the Chain of Custody.

According to WSC-CAM 5/2009 Rev.1, Table 11 A-1, recovery for some VOC analytes have been deemed potentially difficult. 

Although they may still be within the recommended recovery range, a range has been set based on historical control limits.

This work order contains 1 drinking water sample and the required field QC was not submitted.

Some target analytes which are not listed as exceptions in the Summary of CAM Reporting Limits may exceed the recommended RL 

based on sample initial volume or weight provided, % moisture content, or responsiveness of a particular analyte to purge and trap 

instrumentation.

See below for any non-conformances and issues relating to quality control samples and/or sample analysis/matrix.

Notes and Definitions

Data reported from a dilutionD

Analyte out of acceptance range in QC spike but no reportable concentration present in sample.QC2

The spike recovery was outside acceptance limits for the MS and/or MSD.  The batch was accepted based on acceptable 

LCS recovery.

QM7

The RPD result exceeded the QC control limits; however, both percent recoveries were acceptable. Sample results for the 

QC batch were accepted based on percent recoveries and completeness of QC data.

QR2

Data confirmed with duplicate analysis.V11

RPD Relative Percent Difference

dry Sample results reported on a dry weight basis

Not ReportedNR

Laboratory Control Sample (LCS):  A known matrix spiked with compound(s) representative of the target analytes, which is used to 

document laboratory performance.

Matrix Duplicate:  An intra-laboratory split sample which is used to document the precision of a method in a given sample matrix.

Matrix Spike:  An aliquot of a sample spiked with a known concentration of target analyte(s).  The spiking occurs prior to sample 

preparation and analysis.  A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.

Method Blank:  An analyte-free matrix to which all reagents are added in the same volumes or proportions as used in sample 

processing.  The method blank should be carried through the complete sample preparation and analytical procedure.  The method blank 

is used to document contamination resulting from the analytical process.

Method Detection Limit (MDL):  The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence 

that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type containing the 

analyte.

Reportable Detection Limit (RDL):  The lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and 

accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions.  For many analytes the RDL analyte concentration is selected as the lowest 

non-zero standard in the calibration curve.  While the RDL is approximately 5 to 10 times the MDL, the RDL for each sample takes 

into account the sample volume/weight, extract/digestate volume, cleanup procedures and, if applicable, dry weight correction.  Sample 

RDLs are highly matrix-dependent.

Surrogate:  An organic compound which is similar to the target analyte(s) in chemical composition and behavior in the analytical 

process, but which is not normally found in environmental samples.  These compounds are spiked into all blanks, standards, and 

samples prior to analysis.  Percent recoveries are calculated for each surrogate.

Continuing Calibration Verification:  The calibration relationship established during the initial calibration must be verified at periodic 

intervals.  Concentrations, intervals, and criteria are method specific.

CASE NARRATIVE:

Data has been reported to the RDL.  This report excludes estimated concentrations detected below the RDL and above the MDL 

(J-Flag).

All non-detects and all results below the reporting limit are reported as < (less than) the reporting limit in this report.

The samples were received 4.1 degrees Celsius, please refer to the Chain of Custody for details specific to temperature upon receipt.  

An infrared thermometer with a tolerance of +/- 1.0 degrees Celsius was used immediately upon receipt of the samples.

If a Matrix Spike (MS), Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) or Duplicate (DUP) was not requested on the Chain of Custody, method 

criteria may have been fulfilled with a source sample not of this Sample Delivery Group.

MADEP has published a list of analytical methods (CAM) which provides a series of recommended protocols for the acquisition, 

analysis and reporting of analytical data in support of MCP decisions.  "Presumptive Certainty" can be established only for those 

methods published by the MADEP in the MCP CAM.  The compounds and/or elements reported were specifically requested by the 

client on the Chain of Custody and in some cases may not include the full analyte list as defined in the method.  Regulatory limits may 

not be achieved if specific method and/or technique was not requested on the Chain of Custody.

According to WSC-CAM 5/2009 Rev.1, Table 11 A-1, recovery for some VOC analytes have been deemed potentially difficult. 

Although they may still be within the recommended recovery range, a range has been set based on historical control limits.

Some target analytes which are not listed as exceptions in the Summary of CAM Reporting Limits may exceed the recommended RL 

based on sample initial volume or weight provided, % moisture content, or responsiveness of a particular analyte to purge and trap 

instrumentation.

See below for any non-conformances and issues relating to quality control samples and/or sample analysis/matrix.

Notes and Definitions

Data reported from a dilutionD

The spike recovery was outside acceptance limits for the MS and/or MSD.  The batch was accepted based on acceptable 

LCS recovery.

QM7

The RPD result exceeded the QC control limits; however, both percent recoveries were acceptable. Sample results for the 

QC batch were accepted based on percent recoveries and completeness of QC data.

QR2

RPD out of acceptance range.QR5

RPD Relative Percent Difference

dry Sample results reported on a dry weight basis

Not ReportedNR

J Detected but below the Reporting Limit; therefore, result is an estimated concentration (CLP J-Flag).

Laboratory Control Sample (LCS):  A known matrix spiked with compound(s) representative of the target analytes, which is used to 

document laboratory performance.

Matrix Duplicate:  An intra-laboratory split sample which is used to document the precision of a method in a given sample matrix.

Matrix Spike:  An aliquot of a sample spiked with a known concentration of target analyte(s).  The spiking occurs prior to sample 

preparation and analysis.  A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.

Method Blank:  An analyte-free matrix to which all reagents are added in the same volumes or proportions as used in sample 

processing.  The method blank should be carried through the complete sample preparation and analytical procedure.  The method blank 

is used to document contamination resulting from the analytical process.

Method Detection Limit (MDL):  The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence 

that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type containing the 

analyte.

Reportable Detection Limit (RDL):  The lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and 

accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions.  For many analytes the RDL analyte concentration is selected as the lowest 

non-zero standard in the calibration curve.  While the RDL is approximately 5 to 10 times the MDL, the RDL for each sample takes 

into account the sample volume/weight, extract/digestate volume, cleanup procedures and, if applicable, dry weight correction.  Sample 

RDLs are highly matrix-dependent.

Surrogate:  An organic compound which is similar to the target analyte(s) in chemical composition and behavior in the analytical 

process, but which is not normally found in environmental samples.  These compounds are spiked into all blanks, standards, and 

samples prior to analysis.  Percent recoveries are calculated for each surrogate.

Continuing Calibration Verification:  The calibration relationship established during the initial calibration must be verified at periodic 

intervals.  Concentrations, intervals, and criteria are method specific.

CASE NARRATIVE:

Data has been reported to the RDL.  This report excludes estimated concentrations detected below the RDL and above the MDL 

(J-Flag).

All non-detects and all results below the reporting limit are reported as < (less than) the reporting limit in this report.

The samples were received 4.1 degrees Celsius, please refer to the Chain of Custody for details specific to temperature upon receipt.  

An infrared thermometer with a tolerance of +/- 1.0 degrees Celsius was used immediately upon receipt of the samples.

If a Matrix Spike (MS), Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) or Duplicate (DUP) was not requested on the Chain of Custody, method 

criteria may have been fulfilled with a source sample not of this Sample Delivery Group.

MADEP has published a list of analytical methods (CAM) which provides a series of recommended protocols for the acquisition, 

analysis and reporting of analytical data in support of MCP decisions.  "Presumptive Certainty" can be established only for those 

methods published by the MADEP in the MCP CAM.  The compounds and/or elements reported were specifically requested by the 

client on the Chain of Custody and in some cases may not include the full analyte list as defined in the method.  Regulatory limits may 

not be achieved if specific method and/or technique was not requested on the Chain of Custody.

According to WSC-CAM 5/2009 Rev.1, Table 11 A-1, recovery for some VOC analytes have been deemed potentially difficult. 

Although they may still be within the recommended recovery range, a range has been set based on historical control limits.

This work order contains 1 drinking water sample and the required field QC was not submitted.

Some target analytes which are not listed as exceptions in the Summary of CAM Reporting Limits may exceed the recommended RL 

based on sample initial volume or weight provided, % moisture content, or responsiveness of a particular analyte to purge and trap 

instrumentation.

See below for any non-conformances and issues relating to quality control samples and/or sample analysis/matrix.

Notes and Definitions

Analyte out of acceptance range in QC spike but no reportable concentration present in sample.QC2

The RPD result exceeded the QC control limits; however, both percent recoveries were acceptable. Sample results for the 

QC batch were accepted based on percent recoveries and completeness of QC data.

dry Sample results reported on a dry weight basis

Not ReportedNR

Laboratory Control Sample (LCS):  A known matrix spiked with compound(s) representative of the target analytes, which is used to 

document laboratory performance.

Matrix Duplicate:  An intra-laboratory split sample which is used to document the precision of a method in a given sample matrix.

Matrix Spike:  An aliquot of a sample spiked with a known concentration of target analyte(s).  The spiking occurs prior to sample 

preparation and analysis.  A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.

Method Blank:  An analyte-free matrix to which all reagents are added in the same volumes or proportions as used in sample 

processing.  The method blank should be carried through the complete sample preparation and analytical procedure.  The method blank 

is used to document contamination resulting from the analytical process.

Method Detection Limit (MDL):  The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence 

that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type containing the 

analyte.

Reportable Detection Limit (RDL):  The lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and 

accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions.  For many analytes the RDL analyte concentration is selected as the lowest 

non-zero standard in the calibration curve.  While the RDL is approximately 5 to 10 times the MDL, the RDL for each sample takes 

into account the sample volume/weight, extract/digestate volume, cleanup procedures and, if applicable, dry weight correction.  Sample 

RDLs are highly matrix-dependent.

Surrogate:  An organic compound which is similar to the target analyte(s) in chemical composition and behavior in the analytical 

process, but which is not normally found in environmental samples.  These compounds are spiked into all blanks, standards, and 

samples prior to analysis.  Percent recoveries are calculated for each surrogate.

Continuing Calibration Verification:  The calibration relationship established during the initial calibration must be verified at periodic 

intervals.  Concentrations, intervals, and criteria are method specific.

CASE NARRATIVE:

Data has been reported to the RDL.  This report excludes estimated concentrations detected below the RDL and above the MDL 

(J-Flag).

All non-detects and all results below the reporting limit are reported as < (less than) the reporting limit in this report.

The samples were received 4.2 degrees Celsius, please refer to the Chain of Custody for details specific to temperature upon receipt.  

An infrared thermometer with a tolerance of +/- 1.0 degrees Celsius was used immediately upon receipt of the samples.

If a Matrix Spike (MS), Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) or Duplicate (DUP) was not requested on the Chain of Custody, method 

criteria may have been fulfilled with a source sample not of this Sample Delivery Group.

MADEP has published a list of analytical methods (CAM) which provides a series of recommended protocols for the acquisition, 

analysis and reporting of analytical data in support of MCP decisions.  "Presumptive Certainty" can be established only for those 

methods published by the MADEP in the MCP CAM.  The compounds and/or elements reported were specifically requested by the 

client on the Chain of Custody and in some cases may not include the full analyte list as defined in the method.  Regulatory limits may 

not be achieved if specific method and/or technique was not requested on the Chain of Custody.

According to WSC-CAM 5/2009 Rev.1, Table 11 A-1, recovery for some VOC analytes have been deemed potentially difficult. 

Although they may still be within the recommended recovery range, a range has been set based on historical control limits.

Some target analytes which are not listed as exceptions in the Summary of CAM Reporting Limits may exceed the recommended RL 

based on sample initial volume or weight provided, % moisture content, or responsiveness of a particular analyte to purge and trap 

instrumentation.

See below for any non-conformances and issues relating to quality control samples and/or sample analysis/matrix.

Notes and Definitions

RPD Relative Percent Difference

dry Sample results reported on a dry weight basis

Not ReportedNR

Laboratory Control Sample (LCS):  A known matrix spiked with compound(s) representative of the target analytes, which is used to 

document laboratory performance.

Matrix Duplicate:  An intra-laboratory split sample which is used to document the precision of a method in a given sample matrix.

Matrix Spike:  An aliquot of a sample spiked with a known concentration of target analyte(s).  The spiking occurs prior to sample 

preparation and analysis.  A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.

Method Blank:  An analyte-free matrix to which all reagents are added in the same volumes or proportions as used in sample 

processing.  The method blank should be carried through the complete sample preparation and analytical procedure.  The method blank 

is used to document contamination resulting from the analytical process.

Method Detection Limit (MDL):  The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence 

that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type containing the 

analyte.

Reportable Detection Limit (RDL):  The lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and 

accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions.  For many analytes the RDL analyte concentration is selected as the lowest 

non-zero standard in the calibration curve.  While the RDL is approximately 5 to 10 times the MDL, the RDL for each sample takes 

into account the sample volume/weight, extract/digestate volume, cleanup procedures and, if applicable, dry weight correction.  Sample 

RDLs are highly matrix-dependent.

Surrogate:  An organic compound which is similar to the target analyte(s) in chemical composition and behavior in the analytical 

process, but which is not normally found in environmental samples.  These compounds are spiked into all blanks, standards, and 

samples prior to analysis.  Percent recoveries are calculated for each surrogate.

Continuing Calibration Verification:  The calibration relationship established during the initial calibration must be verified at periodic 

intervals.  Concentrations, intervals, and criteria are method specific.

CASE NARRATIVE:

Data has been reported to the RDL.  This report excludes estimated concentrations detected below the RDL and above the MDL 

(J-Flag).

All non-detects and all results below the reporting limit are reported as < (less than) the reporting limit in this report.

The samples were received 4.2 degrees Celsius, please refer to the Chain of Custody for details specific to temperature upon receipt.  

An infrared thermometer with a tolerance of +/- 1.0 degrees Celsius was used immediately upon receipt of the samples.

If a Matrix Spike (MS), Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) or Duplicate (DUP) was not requested on the Chain of Custody, method 

criteria may have been fulfilled with a source sample not of this Sample Delivery Group.

MADEP has published a list of analytical methods (CAM) which provides a series of recommended protocols for the acquisition, 

analysis and reporting of analytical data in support of MCP decisions.  "Presumptive Certainty" can be established only for those 

methods published by the MADEP in the MCP CAM.  The compounds and/or elements reported were specifically requested by the 

client on the Chain of Custody and in some cases may not include the full analyte list as defined in the method.  Regulatory limits may 

not be achieved if specific method and/or technique was not requested on the Chain of Custody.

According to WSC-CAM 5/2009 Rev.1, Table 11 A-1, recovery for some VOC analytes have been deemed potentially difficult. 

Although they may still be within the recommended recovery range, a range has been set based on historical control limits.

Some target analytes which are not listed as exceptions in the Summary of CAM Reporting Limits may exceed the recommended RL 

based on sample initial volume or weight provided, % moisture content, or responsiveness of a particular analyte to purge and trap 

instrumentation.

TOC via Lloyd Kahn Case Narrative:

Following the acidification via a 1:1 phosphoric acid solution to remove the inorganic carbon, the sample is dried in a 100°C oven for 

10-15 minutes.  A homogenous sample is then weighed into the platinum boat and tested, on a dry weight basis, for TOC using the 

Lloyd Kahn method.

See below for any non-conformances and issues relating to quality control samples and/or sample analysis/matrix.

Notes and Definitions

RPD Relative Percent Difference

dry Sample results reported on a dry weight basis

Not ReportedNR

Laboratory Control Sample (LCS):  A known matrix spiked with compound(s) representative of the target analytes, which is used to 

document laboratory performance.

Matrix Duplicate:  An intra-laboratory split sample which is used to document the precision of a method in a given sample matrix.

Matrix Spike:  An aliquot of a sample spiked with a known concentration of target analyte(s).  The spiking occurs prior to sample 

preparation and analysis.  A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.

Method Blank:  An analyte-free matrix to which all reagents are added in the same volumes or proportions as used in sample 

processing.  The method blank should be carried through the complete sample preparation and analytical procedure.  The method blank 

is used to document contamination resulting from the analytical process.

Method Detection Limit (MDL):  The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence 

that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type containing the 

analyte.

Reportable Detection Limit (RDL):  The lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and 

accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions.  For many analytes the RDL analyte concentration is selected as the lowest 

non-zero standard in the calibration curve.  While the RDL is approximately 5 to 10 times the MDL, the RDL for each sample takes 

into account the sample volume/weight, extract/digestate volume, cleanup procedures and, if applicable, dry weight correction.  Sample 

RDLs are highly matrix-dependent.

Surrogate:  An organic compound which is similar to the target analyte(s) in chemical composition and behavior in the analytical 

process, but which is not normally found in environmental samples.  These compounds are spiked into all blanks, standards, and 

samples prior to analysis.  Percent recoveries are calculated for each surrogate.

Continuing Calibration Verification:  The calibration relationship established during the initial calibration must be verified at periodic 

intervals.  Concentrations, intervals, and criteria are method specific.

CASE NARRATIVE:

Data has been reported to the RDL.  This report excludes estimated concentrations detected below the RDL and above the MDL 

(J-Flag).

All non-detects and all results below the reporting limit are reported as < (less than) the reporting limit in this report.

The samples were received 4.2 degrees Celsius, please refer to the Chain of Custody for details specific to temperature upon receipt.  

An infrared thermometer with a tolerance of +/- 1.0 degrees Celsius was used immediately upon receipt of the samples.

If a Matrix Spike (MS), Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) or Duplicate (DUP) was not requested on the Chain of Custody, method 

criteria may have been fulfilled with a source sample not of this Sample Delivery Group.

MADEP has published a list of analytical methods (CAM) which provides a series of recommended protocols for the acquisition, 

analysis and reporting of analytical data in support of MCP decisions.  "Presumptive Certainty" can be established only for those 

methods published by the MADEP in the MCP CAM.  The compounds and/or elements reported were specifically requested by the 

client on the Chain of Custody and in some cases may not include the full analyte list as defined in the method.  Regulatory limits may 

not be achieved if specific method and/or technique was not requested on the Chain of Custody.

According to WSC-CAM 5/2009 Rev.1, Table 11 A-1, recovery for some VOC analytes have been deemed potentially difficult. 

Although they may still be within the recommended recovery range, a range has been set based on historical control limits.

Some target analytes which are not listed as exceptions in the Summary of CAM Reporting Limits may exceed the recommended RL 

based on sample initial volume or weight provided, % moisture content, or responsiveness of a particular analyte to purge and trap 

instrumentation.

Sample Acceptance Policy Case Narrative:

Spectrum Analytical Sample Acceptance Policy, in conjunction with NELAC Sample Acceptance Policy (5.5.8.3.2.),  require that all 

samples submitted must have labels attached to each container identifying the sample ID, site location, and/or project number and the 

collection date written in indelible ink. This is necessary in order to ensure identifiable samples and to maintain sample integrity.  

Containers in this work order were received without sample labels attached to the sample jars (bottles).  Please insure that all sample 

containers are properly labeled with a unique sample ID, site location, and/or project number and collection date.

See below for any non-conformances and issues relating to quality control samples and/or sample analysis/matrix.

Notes and Definitions

Data reported from a dilutionD

The spike recovery was outside acceptance limits for the MS and/or MSD.  The batch was accepted based on acceptable 

LCS recovery.

QM7

The RPD result exceeded the QC control limits; however, both percent recoveries were acceptable. Sample results for the 

QC batch were accepted based on percent recoveries and completeness of QC data.

QR2

RPD out of acceptance range.QR5

RPD Relative Percent Difference

dry Sample results reported on a dry weight basis

Not ReportedNR

J Detected but below the Reporting Limit; therefore, result is an estimated concentration (CLP J-Flag).

Laboratory Control Sample (LCS):  A known matrix spiked with compound(s) representative of the target analytes, which is used to 

document laboratory performance.

Matrix Duplicate:  An intra-laboratory split sample which is used to document the precision of a method in a given sample matrix.

Matrix Spike:  An aliquot of a sample spiked with a known concentration of target analyte(s).  The spiking occurs prior to sample 

preparation and analysis.  A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.

Method Blank:  An analyte-free matrix to which all reagents are added in the same volumes or proportions as used in sample 

processing.  The method blank should be carried through the complete sample preparation and analytical procedure.  The method blank 

is used to document contamination resulting from the analytical process.

Method Detection Limit (MDL):  The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence 

that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type containing the 

analyte.

Reportable Detection Limit (RDL):  The lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and 

accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions.  For many analytes the RDL analyte concentration is selected as the lowest 

non-zero standard in the calibration curve.  While the RDL is approximately 5 to 10 times the MDL, the RDL for each sample takes 

into account the sample volume/weight, extract/digestate volume, cleanup procedures and, if applicable, dry weight correction.  Sample 

RDLs are highly matrix-dependent.

Surrogate:  An organic compound which is similar to the target analyte(s) in chemical composition and behavior in the analytical 

process, but which is not normally found in environmental samples.  These compounds are spiked into all blanks, standards, and 

samples prior to analysis.  Percent recoveries are calculated for each surrogate.

Continuing Calibration Verification:  The calibration relationship established during the initial calibration must be verified at periodic 

intervals.  Concentrations, intervals, and criteria are method specific.

CASE NARRATIVE:

Data has been reported to the RDL.  This report excludes estimated concentrations detected below the RDL and above the MDL 

(J-Flag).

All non-detects and all results below the reporting limit are reported as < (less than) the reporting limit in this report.

The samples were received 0.2 degrees Celsius, please refer to the Chain of Custody for details specific to temperature upon receipt.  

An infrared thermometer with a tolerance of +/- 1.0 degrees Celsius was used immediately upon receipt of the samples.

If a Matrix Spike (MS), Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) or Duplicate (DUP) was not requested on the Chain of Custody, method 

criteria may have been fulfilled with a source sample not of this Sample Delivery Group.

MADEP has published a list of analytical methods (CAM) which provides a series of recommended protocols for the acquisition, 

analysis and reporting of analytical data in support of MCP decisions.  "Presumptive Certainty" can be established only for those 

methods published by the MADEP in the MCP CAM.  The compounds and/or elements reported were specifically requested by the 

client on the Chain of Custody and in some cases may not include the full analyte list as defined in the method.  Regulatory limits may 

not be achieved if specific method and/or technique was not requested on the Chain of Custody.

According to WSC-CAM 5/2009 Rev.1, Table 11 A-1, recovery for some VOC analytes have been deemed potentially difficult. 

Although they may still be within the recommended recovery range, a range has been set based on historical control limits.

Some target analytes which are not listed as exceptions in the Summary of CAM Reporting Limits may exceed the recommended RL 

based on sample initial volume or weight provided, % moisture content, or responsiveness of a particular analyte to purge and trap 

instrumentation.

Laboratory Control Sample (LCS):  A known matrix spiked with compound(s) representative of the target analytes, which is used to 

document laboratory performance.

Matrix Duplicate:  An intra-laboratory split sample which is used to document the precision of a method in a given sample matrix.

Matrix Spike:  An aliquot of a sample spiked with a known concentration of target analyte(s).  The spiking occurs prior to sample 

preparation and analysis.  A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.

Method Blank:  An analyte-free matrix to which all reagents are added in the same volumes or proportions as used in sample 

processing.  The method blank should be carried through the complete sample preparation and analytical procedure.  The method blank 

is used to document contamination resulting from the analytical process.

Method Detection Limit (MDL):  The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence 

that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type containing the 

analyte.

Reportable Detection Limit (RDL):  The lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and 

accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions.  For many analytes the RDL analyte concentration is selected as the lowest 

non-zero standard in the calibration curve.  While the RDL is approximately 5 to 10 times the MDL, the RDL for each sample takes 

into account the sample volume/weight, extract/digestate volume, cleanup procedures and, if applicable, dry weight correction.  Sample 

RDLs are highly matrix-dependent.

Surrogate:  An organic compound which is similar to the target analyte(s) in chemical composition and behavior in the analytical 

process, but which is not normally found in environmental samples.  These compounds are spiked into all blanks, standards, and 

samples prior to analysis.  Percent recoveries are calculated for each surrogate.

Continuing Calibration Verification:  The calibration relationship established during the initial calibration must be verified at periodic 

intervals.  Concentrations, intervals, and criteria are method specific.
