1.0 INTRODUCTION

On behalf of CSX Transportation (CSXT), Amec Foster Wheeler Environment & Infrastructure,
Inc. (Amec Foster Wheeler) has prepared this Immediate Response Action (IRA) Completion
Report and Permanent Solution Statement with Conditions for a diesel fuel release that
occurred on the afternoon of November 7, 2014 at the CSX Intermodal Terminal facility located
at 271 Franklin Street, Worcester, Massachusetts (hereinafter referred to as “facility”). The area
where the diesel fuel release has come to be located is referred to as the “Site” or “Disposal
Site”.

Due to a faulty filter canister clamp located on the engine of a locomotive, approximately 2,300
gallons of diesel fuel were released onto the surrounding ballast. The majority of the release
migrated on top of an impermeable plastic geomembrane that had previously been installed in
the subsurface on the north side of the tracks.  The geomembrane directed the release to an
underground storm water collection system that ultimately discharged into an onsite storm water
retention pond.

Per 310 CMR 40.0311(3) of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP), the release required
reporting to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) because it
met the following two hour reporting criteria:

1. a sudden release to the environment;

2. an oil sheen on surface water (this was later deemed storm water, not surface
water); and

3. a release to a storm drain.

As required by 310 CMR 40.1056 of the MCP, this Permanent Solution Statement contains
information and data to demonstrate that a Condition of No Significant Risk exists for the Site.
A Method 1 risk characterization, as defined in 310 CMR 40.0900, was completed by Amec
Foster Wheeler to characterize the risk of harm to health, safety, public welfare and the
environment for current uses of the Site and to demonstrate a Condition of No Significant Risk.

In accordance with 310 CMR 40.1040(1) and 310 CMR 40.1041(1), a Permanent Solution
Statement with Conditions applies to the Disposal Site since:

 A level of No Significant Risk exists or has been achieved;

 All sources of oil and/or hazardous materials (OHM) have been eliminated or controlled;

 The level of OHM in the environment has been reduced as close to background levels
as feasible;

 Concentrations of OHM do not exceed the applicable Upper Concentration Limits
(UCLs);

 Maintaining a level of No Significant Risk will not require an Activity and Use Limitation
(AUL); and

 Limitations or conditions to the Permanent Solution apply because residential Method 1
S-1 standards for future unrestrictive use were not achieved for one volatile petroleum
hydrocarbon (VPH) fraction and the Site is located within a railroad right-of-way.

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RELEASE DESCRIPTION

2.1 SITE LOCATION, DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

The release location has the Zone 19 universal transverse mercator (UTM) coordinates of
4,682,605 meters north and 269,983 meters east.  The latitude and longitude are 42.26222
degrees north and 71.78766 degrees west.  The address of the CSX facility where the release
occurred is 271 Franklin Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  The Site Location Map, Figure 1,
shows the regional topographic features of the areas located in the vicinity of the Disposal Site.
The Facility Plan providing an aerial view of the features in the immediate vicinity of the
Disposal Site is shown as Figure 2.

According to the City of Worcester property field card for 271 Franklin Street, the facility is
comprised of 68 acres that is used primarily for the loading and unloading of intermodal
containers from rail cars.  The facility encompasses an area that is bounded by industrial,
commercial and residential properties.  It is secured by fencing and locked gates.  Franklin
Street bisects the center portion of the facility.  The facility underwent major renovations in
2012, when additional property was acquired, the current CSX office was constructed, the
layout of the railroad tracks were redesigned and reconfigured, and a self-contained onsite
subsurface storm water collection system which includes four on-site retention ponds was
constructed. Figure 2 shows the location of the locomotive at the time the diesel fuel release
occurred, the underground storm water drainage system conduit that the majority of the fuel was
directed through, and the onsite retention pond that it was released to.

The CSX office building is located in the western portion of the facility and is accessed via
Franklin Street.  The four unlined storm water retention ponds are located north of Franklin
Street, and referred to as retention ponds #1A, #1B, #2 and #3.  As shown on Figure 2,
retention pond #1A is located west of the CSX offices in the far western portion of the facility
adjacent to Route I-290.  It connects via underground culverts to retention pond #1B which is
located immediately north of Franklin Street in the central western portion of the facility.
Retention pond #2 is located in the center of the facility immediately north of Franklin Street.
Any overflow from retention pond #2 is directed via two underground concrete culverts to
retention pond #3 located east of retention pond #2. Entry into the facility to the south of
Franklin Street is via Barbara Lane which is accessed by an underpass running under Franklin
Street between retention pond #2 and retention pond #3.

The majority of the facility is paved except for the four retention ponds and their associated
banks and the railroad tracks, the surface of which contains stone railroad ballast.  The facility is
topographically flat and located at an elevation of approximately 477 feet above mean sea level.
Land located immediately north of the facility is located at a topographically lower elevation.
Land located immediately south of the facility is located at a topographically higher elevation.
As shown on Figure 1, numerous hills are located in the vicinity of the facility to the north,
southeast and south.

According to historic Sanborn maps that were reviewed, the facility has been used as a rail yard
since sometime prior to 1892.

2.2 SENSITIVE RECEPTORS

According to the MassDEP Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup Phase I Site Assessment Map,
provided as Figure 3, the Disposal Site is located within a medium yield non-potential drinking
water source area.  No other sensitive receptors are located within 500 feet of the Disposal Site,
including current or potential drinking water source areas as defined by the MCP (i.e. Zone II,
Interim Wellhead Protection Areas (IWPA) or Zone A surface water bodies), Federal Emergency
Management Act (FEMA) 100-year floodplains, Areas of Critical Environmental Concern
(ACEC), rare wetland wildlife habitats, or certified or potential vernal pools.  The nearest FEMA
100-year floodplain is located approximately 1,500 feet west of the Disposal Site.  The nearest
protected open spaces are located approximately 1,000 feet southeast and 1,200 feet north of
the Disposal Site. Four onsite man-made storm water retention ponds that were constructed in
2012 are located at the facility.  The nearest off-site surface water body is Bell Pond which is
located approximately 3,000 feet north of the Disposal Site.  The closest sensitive receptor is
the Seven Hills Charter School which is located approximately 1,200 feet north of the Disposal
Site. No wetland areas are located within one-half mile of the Disposal Site.

2.3 DESCRIPTION OF RELEASE

At approximately 1:00 p.m. on November 7, 2014, a CSX employee observed petroleum
staining on the ballast and pavement below an idling locomotive (#5498), recently arrived from
Cleveland, Ohio, that was parked at track number SU2.  Upon further inspection, it was noted
that the filter canister clamp located on the engine of the locomotive was broken, which caused
a rapid release of diesel fuel onto the surrounding ballast and pavement.  The quantity of fuel
that was released was initially unknown, as the volume of fuel that was in the fuel tank prior to
the release was not available. The quantity of fuel that was still present inside the fuel tank and
sump was also not known.  As soon as the release was discovered, the CSX employee
immediately shut down the engine of the locomotive and contacted his supervisor who
contacted the CSXT Public Safety Coordination Center.

Oral notification of the release was provided with a telefax to the National Response Center by
Ms. Alexis Romine of CSXT at 1:15 p.m. on November 7, 2014 which was received by
MassDEP.  As the approximate release quantity was initially unknown, it was reported by CSXT
as being greater than five gallons.  CSXT indicated at the time of notification that they had
mobilized their emergency response contractor, Global Remediation Services of East Taunton,
Massachusetts (Global) to respond to the release and initiate response actions.  MassDEP
assigned Release Tracking Number (RTN) 2-19355 to the release.

At 2:10 p.m., Mr. Michael Bethge of CSXT contacted the MassDEP and spoke to Mr. Dino
Dellechiaie to update him that the quantity of the release, although still unknown, would likely be
“greater than ten times the reportable quantity”.  Mr. Bethge stated that the diesel fuel which
was released from the locomotive was directed through the ballast which sloped to an onsite
storm water retention pond located at the facility (Retention Pond #2) via a recently designed
and constructed self-contained storm water collection system.  The storm water system is
comprised of a subsurface drain underlain by an impermeable plastic geomembrane liner that
was placed below the track ballast on the northern side of track SU2; it directs storm water and
petroleum to a concrete conduit that is 30 inches in diameter which discharged to unlined
retention pond #2, as shown on Figure 2.  This system was specifically designed to limit
releases to the environment.  As soon as the distinctly visible red colored diesel fuel was

observed in the pond, CSX personnel closed the gate valve leading to the pond located in the
northern end of the pond, preventing further migration of the fuel oil into the pond.

CSXT retained Susan O’Brien as the Licensed Site Professional (LSP) employed at Amec
Foster Wheeler to provide LSP services and direct response actions.  Amec Foster Wheeler
arrived at the facility on the afternoon of November 7, 2014 to oversee response actions that
were being undertaken by Global.  CSXT also notified the Worcester Fire Department who
arrived to the facility on the afternoon of November 7, 2014 to oversee the response actions.

Based on information that was obtained from CSXT, including the initial volume of diesel fuel
that was present in the locomotive when it left Cleveland, Ohio on November 4, 2014 along with
several other locomotives, as well as typical fuel usage and the calculated volume of diesel fuel
remaining in the tank and sump after the release occurred, the estimated release volume of
diesel fuel was determined to be between 2,280 and 2,300 gallons. Ms. O’Brien orally provided
a revised estimated volume of diesel fuel released to the MassDEP on November 10, 2014.

2.4 OHM USE AND STORAGE

No OHM is stored within the release area, except for OHM that may be used or stored in trains
or locomotives that travel or occupy the tracks.  Typical OHM used in trains and locomotives
includes diesel fuel and lubricants.  Within the facility, the trains are fueled with diesel fuel via
tanker trucks which periodically visit the Site on an as needed basis.

2.5 GEOLOGY

According to information obtained from a subsurface investigation conducted in the locomotive
release area on December 30, 2015, overburden soil beginning at the ground surface was
characterized as ballast consisting of one to two inch diameter angular rocks to a depth ranging
from 6 to 12 inches below the ground surface (bgs), followed by dry fill material described as
dark brown sand with varying amounts of silt, gravel and cobbles that was encountered to a
depth of approximately nine feet bgs. A clay layer was encountered in two soil borings (SB-1
and SB-4) at a depth ranging from 9 to 10 feet bgs, followed by a lens of fine to medium sand to
the bottom of each boring.  The water table was encountered at a depth of approximately
12 feet bgs. Bedrock was not encountered during the advancement of any soil borings at the
Site and no bedrock outcrops were observed either at the Site or in the vicinity of the Site.

2.6 HYDROGEOLOGY

Based on the information obtained from the December 30, 2015 subsurface investigation,
groundwater was not affected by the release.  The depth to the water table in the locomotive
release area is located at a depth of approximately 12 feet bgs. Although no groundwater
investigations were performed, it is assumed that groundwater flows in a northerly direction
based on the topography elevations and location of the closest off-site surface water body. The
depth to the water table is unknown in the area of retention pond #2.  The pond is often dry and
excavation activities occurred at the bottom of the pond (on both sides of the gate valve) to a
depth of approximately three feet bgs, with no groundwater being encountered below the
excavation.

2.7 APPLICABLE SOIL CATEGORIES

Applicable soil categories for the Disposal Site are based on the potential for exposure of adult
and children receptors for both current and reasonably foreseeable Site activities and uses as
outlined in 310 CMR 40.0933.

Intensity of Use: Pursuant to 310 CMR 40.0933(4)(b) of the MCP, intensity of use is described
as high for activities and uses which have the potential to disturb the soil such as gardening,
digging and recreational sports, resulting in either direct contact with the soil itself or inhalation
of soil-derived dust.  Passive activities which do not disturb the soil are characterized as low
intensity use and include activities such as walking, shopping, and bird watching. Low intensity
applies to the Disposal Site, since it is located within an active rail yard where only low intensity
activities occur.

Frequency of Use: Pursuant to 310 CMR 40.0933(4)(a), children’s frequency of use is
described as high if they reside, attend school or day care at the Disposal Site or if large
numbers of children visit the Disposal Site, regardless of any one child’s frequency of visitation.
Adults’ frequency of use is considered high when they reside at the Disposal Site or when they
work there on a continuing basis.  Adults’ or children’s frequency of use is considered low when
they are present at the Disposal Site as infrequent visitors or when workers are present at the
Disposal Site only for short periods of time.  For this Disposal Site which is located within an
active rail yard that is surrounded by secured fencing and locked gates, children are not present
at the Disposal Site and the frequency of use for adults who work at the Disposal Site is
considered high.

Accessibility: Under current Site conditions, impacted soils at the Disposal Site are
considered to be “potentially accessible” at depths ranging from ground surface to 15 feet bgs in
all areas of the Disposal Site that are covered with impervious surfaces (asphalt paving,
concrete pads), as well as between 3 and 15 feet bgs in those areas of the Disposal Site that
are unpaved or improved with landscaping.  In the unpaved and landscaped areas, all soil
located between ground surface and 3 feet bgs is considered “accessible”.  Soil located at
depths greater than 15 feet bgs or beneath a building considered “isolated subsurface” soil.
Under unrestricted future Site uses, all soil located between ground surface and 15 feet bgs is
considered to be “accessible” soil and all soil located at depths greater than 15 feet bgs is
considered to be “isolated subsurface” soil.

Based on the frequency of use and intensity of activities discussed above, the Soil Category
Selection Matrix provided 310 CMR 40.0933(9) of the MCP was used to determine the
applicable soil categories for the Disposal Site.  According to the matrix, the soil at the Disposal
Site is considered “accessible” (the S-2 category applies) in unpaved areas at a depth of 0 to 3
feet bgs.  It is also considered “potentially accessible” (the S-3 category applies) in unpaved
areas at a depth of 3 to 15 feet bgs or paved areas at a depth of 0 to 15 feet bgs.  The soil is
considered “isolated” (the S-3 category applies) at a depth greater than 15 feet bgs or below the
footprint of a building or permanent structure. For unrestricted future uses of the Disposal Site,
all soil between 0 and 15 feet bgs is considered S-1 soil, and all soil located greater than 15 feet
bgs is considered S-3 soil.  However, because the Disposal Site is located within a railroad
right-of-way, Site use and soil categories applicable to the Disposal Site are expected to remain
the same in the future.

2.8 APPLICABLE GROUNDWATER CATEGORIES

Groundwater is categorized based on its potential:

 for human consumption (GW-1);

 to act as a source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to inhalation of indoor air
(GW-2); and

 to affect the aquatic environment after discharge to surface water (GW-3).

GW-1 category is not applicable as the Disposal Site is not located within a current or potential
drinking water source area or a municipal aquifer protection district and private potable wells are
not located within the vicinity of the Disposal Site.

The GW-2 category, which considers groundwater as a potential source of vapors to indoor air,
applies to groundwater that is located within 30 feet of an existing or planned building or
structure that is or will be occupied and the average annual depth to groundwater in that area is
15 feet or less.  The depth to groundwater at the locomotive release area is approximately
12 feet bgs and is unknown but assumed to be less than 15 feet bgs in the retention pond #2
area.  The nearest occupied building from retention pond #2 is the CSX office which is located
approximately 600 feet to the west.  The nearest occupied building from the locomotive release
area is a commercial building located 250 feet to the north.  Based on this information, the
GW-2 standard is not applicable for the Disposal Site.

All groundwater is considered a potential source of discharge to surface water and is classified
as GW-3.

3.0 IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACTIONS

This section describes the IRA remedial and assessment activities which occurred at the
Disposal Site chronologically by date.

3.1 NOVEMBER 7, 2014 ACTIVITIES

Global and Amec Foster Wheeler arrived at the CSX facility at approximately 3:00 p.m. on
November 7, 2014 upon being notified of the release.  Global mobilized with the necessary
equipment, including two vacuum trucks with capacities of 3,000 and 5,000 gallons, to conduct
initial response actions.  Global initially used a vacuum truck to remove the remaining volume of
approximately 700 gallons of diesel fuel from the bottom of the locomotive’s fuel tank and sump.

After all the diesel fuel was removed from the locomotive, Global used white paint to mark off
the perimeter of the area on the ground that was visually stained with diesel fuel on both sides
of track SU2.  An impermeable black track pad covered the area between the tracks and
extended approximately one foot on the outsides of both tracks.  As shown on Figure 4, the
area located north of track SU2 consisted of ballast that was 3 feet wide (one foot of which was
covered by the impermeable track pad) followed by an asphalt paved roadway which was
visibly stained.  The dimensions of the staining to the north of the tracks measured 68 feet long
in total by up to 4 feet wide (one foot of which was on pavement).  The area located south of
track SU2 (between tracks SU2 and SU3) consisted only of ballast.  The diesel fuel staining was
present in two areas measuring 22 feet long and 7.5 feet wide (one foot of which was covered
by track pad) to the east and 7.5 feet wide and 6 feet long to the west.

Since the diesel fuel was directed via the subsurface storm water system to retention pond #2,
Global then mobilized to the retention pond.  The prevailing wind was to the east; therefore, the
eastern portion of the pond was stained red from the dyed diesel fuel and free product was
observed on the surface of the pond as shown on Figure 5.  Global skimmed the fuel oil layer
from the pond using the vacuum truck and also installed 100 feet of hard containment boom in
the center of the pond to prevent migration of the diesel fuel to the west.  Absorbent booms and
pads were also placed on the inside of the containment boom and along the sides of the pond in
an effort to contain the fuel oil so that the fuel oil could be easily skimmed from the pond.
Global also placed absorbent booms in front of the gate valve leading to the pond.

Two concrete culverts that are each six feet long are located on the eastern portion of retention
pond #2 to direct overflows from retention pond #2 and under a CSX roadway to retention pond
#3 (see Figure 2).  Since the surface of the water/oil mixture in retention pond #2 was below the
base of the culverts, it was not possible for the oil from retention pond #2 to migrate into
retention pond #3.  However, as a precaution, Global installed absorbent booms inside of the
two concrete culverts.

After approximately 3,000 gallons of the diesel fuel/water mixture was skimmed from the pond,
Global removed the booms and pads that were saturated with diesel fuel, placed them in bags
and containerized them in 55-gallon drums for disposal.  Global also replaced the absorbent
booms and pads inside the containment boom and culverts and beside the gate valve.

Global then mobilized to the manhole access to the underdrain conduit located in a paved
access road on the edge of retention pond #2 near the gate valve (see Figure 2) and pumped
diesel fuel from the underdrain. Once all the product and water were removed, absorbent

booms were placed in the manhole and the gate valve was kept closed to prevent further
migration of the diesel fuel into the retention pond.

Global returned to the locomotive which had been moved to another track to decontaminate the
sides and walkways of the locomotive using absorbent pads, cotton rags, Speedi-dri® and
degreasing materials.  The impacted pads, rags and Speedi-dri® were then placed in bags and
containerized.

Global used oil/water paste and the stick testing method to estimate that of the 3,000 gallons of
fuel and water that were removed on November 7, 2014, approximately 1,300 gallons were
diesel fuel. However, the stick testing was performed prior to complete settling/separation of the
oil and water, and was considered only an estimation.  Global also generated seven drums of
booms, pads and Speedi-dri® at the retention pond area and one drums of pads, rags and
Speedi-dri® at the locomotive release area.

3.2 NOVEMBER 8, 2014 ACTIVITIES

Global and Amec Foster Wheeler, including Susan O’Brien, the LSP-of-Record, arrived to the
Site on the morning of November 8, 2014 to continue conducting response actions.  Global
mobilized with the necessary equipment, including a 5,000-gallon vacuum truck and a
3,000-gallon water truck. They assessed the status of the absorbent booms around the
retention pond and observed that they were not stained with diesel fuel and did not need to be
replaced.  They then opened the manhole near the gate valve and base of the retention pond
and observed free product in the drainline conduit.  They then used the vacuum truck to pump
out an estimated 200 gallons of oil/water mixture from the manhole.

Global then mobilized to track SU2 at the initial location of the diesel fuel release.  They applied
Speedi-dri® to the paved roadway where fuel oil staining was present; afterwards, they placed it
in bags.  Global then used shovels and hand dug two test pits on each side of the SU2 tracks in
the location of the diesel fuel impacts.  Ballast was located to a depth of ten inches bgs followed
by soil.  A plastic geomembrane liner was encountered at a depth of approximately 11 inches
bgs in the northern test pit which was excavated between the SU2 track and the paved
roadway.  No plastic geomembrane liner was encountered in the southern test pit which was
excavated between the SU2 and SU3 tracks to a depth of 1.5 feet bgs.  The test pits were then
backfilled.

In an effort to flush any remaining diesel fuel remaining in the underlying ballast and soil into the
subsurface storm water collection system and toward the retention pond, Global used the on-
site fire hydrant to fill a truck-mounted water tank with 1,200 gallons of water.  They then slowly
released the water onto the ballast area of the locomotive diesel fuel release area.  Another
Global crew was mobilized at the manhole near the base of the retention pond to vacuum out
the oil/water mixture.  At the end of the process, they observed that the sheen that was initially
present in the water located in the manhole was no longer present and that only water was
being captured.  On November 8, 2014, Global vacuumed out a total of 1,950 gallons of the
oil/water mixture. Stick testing was again performed prior to the complete settling of the oil and
water. Approximately 1,050 gallons were measured to be water and an estimated volume of
900 gallons was diesel fuel.

3.3 NOVEMBER 10, 2014 ACTIVITIES

Global arrived on-site on November 10, 2014 with a vacuum truck and proceeded to remove an
additional 1,000 to 1,200 gallons of water with a trace of diesel fuel from the manhole at the
base of the retention pond gate valve.  Global was then shown additional manholes by CSX
personnel that were part of the subsurface storm water collection system which led to the
manhole at the base of retention pond #2.  They proceeded to open each of these manholes
and inspect them for the presence of diesel fuel from the release; however, no diesel fuel was
noted in any of the manholes.  A slight fuel oil odor was present in each of the manholes.  Mr.
Dino Dellechiaie of MassDEP arrived to the Site to observe the response actions being
conducted by Global and assess the condition of the retention pond.

Global then staged a frac tank beside the facility’s oil/water separator.  They then off-loaded the
contents of the two vacuum trucks containing the fuel oil/water mixture from the remedial
activities into the frac tank, as CSXT had not yet selected a disposal option for the oily water,
and Global needed the vacuum trucks for another project.

Susan O’Brien, the LSP-of-Record, spoke to Mr. Dino Dellechiaie of MassDEP to provide an
update on the release quantity and response actions that were in the process of being
conducted.  Mr. Dellechiaie approved an IRA to remove up to 50 cubic yards of impacted soil
from the retention pond.

3.4 NOVEMBER 11, 2014 ACTIVITIES

On November 11, 2014, Global and Amec Foster Wheeler arrived on-site with a vactor truck to
excavate impacted soil and peastone from the sides of retention pond #2 as directed by Amec
Foster Wheeler.  Any soil showing visual and/or olfactory evidence of diesel fuel was removed.
Soils were also screened for total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) using a photoionization
detector (PID). Excavations that were completed along the sidewalls of the pond measured
approximately 200 feet along the northern, eastern and southern sides of the pond, from the
northern end of the boom (at RP-07) to the southern end of the boom (at RP-8).

As shown on Figure 4, samples RP-01 through RP-07 were collected on the north and
northeast sides of the pond, while samples RP-8 through RP-12 were collected along the
southern and southeastern sides of the pond. Samples RP-13 through RP-16 were collected
from the southeast corner of the pond to culvert #2.  In addition, two samples, Culvert-01 and
Culvert-02, were collected at the mouth of the culverts.  The sample identifications, sample
locations relative to direction, the sampling depths and the headspace readings are provided in

With the exception of sample Culvert-02, which exhibited an elevated headspace reading and
required further excavation, all the above 17 samples were submitted to Alpha Analytical
Laboratories of Westborough, Massachusetts (Alpha) for laboratory analysis of extractable
petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH) with diesel range target polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs).  The analytical results showed that no EPH fractions or target PAHs analytes were
detected above the strictest Method 1 S-1/GW-3 standards.  A summary of the analytical results
are provided in Tables 1 and 2.

Approximately 15 cubic yards of diesel fuel impacted soil and peastone were excavated and
then off-loaded into a roll-off container which was labeled, covered with a tarp and staged in the
CSX parking lot.  Global also initiated the hand removal of the rip rap from the side of the
retention pond at the gate valve as directed by Amec Foster Wheeler.  The diesel fuel impacted
rip rap was stockpiled onsite and placed on top of and covered with poly sheeting.

3.5 NOVEMBER 12, 2015 ACTIVITIES

In an attempt to locate the impermeable geomembrane liner and/or clay substrate in the area of
the diesel fuel release, on November 12, 2014, as directed by Amec Foster Wheeler, Global
excavated three test pits between tracks SU2 and SU3 by hand using shovels to a depth of
approximately two feet bgs.  No impermeable geomembrane liner was encountered in any of
the test pits. Stone ballast was present to a depth of approximately ten inches bgs followed by
soil comprised of black fine to medium sand and silt with some gravel.  Soil saturated with diesel
fuel and free product was observed to be entering one of the test pits (Testpit-02) located in the
westernmost release area.  Prior to backfilling the test pits, Amec Foster Wheeler collected a
soil sample from the test pit excavated in the easternmost release area, identified as Testpit-01,
for headspace screening and laboratory analysis at a depth of two feet bgs. The approximate

location of the test pits is shown on Figure 5.  The headspace screening result was 25.1 ppm.
The sample was submitted to Alpha for laboratory analysis of EPH fractions and diesel range
target PAHs.  The laboratory report revealed that although all three EPH fractions and two
target PAHs were detected above the laboratory reporting limits, no analytes were detected
above the strictest Method 1 S-1/GW-3 standards.  A summary of the analytical results are
provided in Table 3.

Because of the lack of precipitation over the preceding several days, standing water was no
longer present in retention pond #2. On November 12, 2014, Global and Amec Foster Wheeler
then mobilized to the retention pond, and used shovels and a vactor truck to remove
approximately 10 cubic yards of diesel fuel impacted rip rap and soil located to the east of the
gate valve area based on headspace screening results, as well as visual and olfactory evidence
of contamination as directed by Amec Foster Wheeler.  After the excavation was completed, the
dimensions of the excavation were 14 feet long by ten feet wide by three feet deep (from the
bottom of the rip rap). As shown on the inset in Figure 4, a total of four sidewall samples
(Sidewall-01 through Sidewall-04) and one bottom sample (Bot-01) were collected for
headspace screening and laboratory analysis.  The sidewall samples were collected
approximately 0.5 feet above the bottom of the excavation.  As shown on Table 2, the highest
headspace screening result was 7.5 ppm.  The samples from these locations were collected
and submitted to Alpha for laboratory analysis of EPH fractions and diesel range target PAHs.
The analytical results showed that no analytes were detected in Sidewall-01 above the
laboratory reporting limits.  No target PAHs were detected in any of the five samples above the
laboratory reporting limits.  Low concentrations of EPH fractions were detected in the remaining
samples well below the strictest Method 1 S-1/GW-3 standards.  A summary of the analytical
results is provided in Table 2.

Global temporarily placed the excavated soil in a stockpile on top of poly sheeting in the bottom
of the pond and covered both the stockpile and the excavation area with poly sheeting.  Global
also changed out the absorbent boom in the manhole near the base of the retention pond gate
valve. They also placed a boom at the gate valve outlet.

Amec Foster Wheeler also collected one storm water sample from the concrete dam area of the
overflow retention pond #3 using a long pole with a plastic cup to collect the water in order to
confirm that there was no diesel fuel impacted storm water entering this retention pond from
retention pond #2.  The storm water sample, Retention Pond-01, was submitted to Alpha for
laboratory analysis of EPH with diesel range target PAHs.  The analytical results showed that
two of the three EPH fractions and all diesel range target PAHs were not detected above the
laboratory reporting limits.  Only one EPH fraction was detected slightly above the laboratory
reporting limit but well below the Method 1 GW-3 standard that was used as a screening
evaluation.  A summary of the storm water analytical results is provided in Table 4.

3.6 NOVEMBER 13, 2014 ACTIVITIES

On November 13, 2014, Global initially transferred the stockpiled soil from November 12, 2014
retention pond excavation activities to a roll off container.

Global then mobilized to the tracks and re-excavated the test pit, Testpit-02, in the area
between tracks SU2 and SU3 that previously exhibited the free product with the intention of
removing the free product using a vacuum truck and installing a PVC slotted screen in order to
capture the product in that area.  A test pit with dimensions of 30 inches by 20 inches and 23

inches deep was excavated.  Although oil saturated soil was encountered, there was no free
product which entered the excavation; therefore, the PVC screen was not installed.  Amec
Foster Wheeler collected a soil sample from the bottom of the test pit, identified as Testpit-02,
for headspace screening and laboratory analysis. The headspace screening result was 95 ppm.
The sample was submitted to Alpha for laboratory analysis of VPH with target VOCs and EPH
with diesel range target PAHs.  The results showed that one VPH fraction and one EPH fraction
were detected above the strictest Method 1 S-1/GW-3 standards. However, no VPH fractions,
EPH fractions, target VOCs, or target PAHs were detected in the sample above the applicable
Method 1 S-2/GW-3 standards.  A summary of the analytical results is provided in Table 3.

Global and Amec Foster Wheeler then returned to retention pond #2 to excavate the diesel fuel
impacted peastone from below the concrete culverts which lead to retention pond #3.  After
excavating two feet under the culverts, diesel fuel-impacted peastone was still encountered.  A
headspace of 58 ppm was obtained from the impacted peastone.  Diesel fuel-impacted soil that
was encountered below the peastone was also removed. The dimensions of the culvert
excavation were 12 feet in length by four feet in width.  Two additional feet of soil were further
excavated underneath the culvert structure as shown on Figure 4.  After excavation activities
were completed, wooden planks were placed under the concrete base to support the structure.
Absorbent booms were placed under the culvert in the excavated area and inside the culvert
openings.

Two confirmatory soil samples were collected from the top and bottom of the culvert excavation
(Culvert-02 Bottom and Culvert-02 Top) for headspace screening and laboratory analysis.  The
Culvert-02 Top sample was collected two feet inside the structure from the sidewall at the top of
the structure. The headspace readings were 2.1 ppm for Culvert-02 Bottom and 54.1 ppm for
Culvert-02 Top.  The samples were submitted to Alpha for laboratory analysis of EPH plus
diesel range target PAHs.  The analytical results showed that no analytes were detected in
Culvert-02 Bottom above the laboratory reporting limits.  No target PAHs were detected in
Culvert-02 Top above the laboratory reporting limits.  All three EPH fractions were detected in
Culvert-02 Top above the laboratory reporting limits but well below the strictest Method 1
S-1/GW-3 standards.  A summary of the soil analytical results is provided in Table 2. The gate
valve continued to be shut so that no water could enter the retention pond.

3.7 NOVEMBER 17, 2014 ACTIVITIES

Due to a heavy rainfall event, on November 17, 2014, Global mobilized a vacuum truck to pump
out the water in the manhole of the storm water collection system at the base of retention pond
#2.  A total of 12,000 gallons was removed from the manhole.  It was off-loaded into the facility’s
groundwater treatment system located next to the oil/water separator.  However, the pumping
rate was not sufficient to remove quickly enough the heavy volume of precipitation entering into
the manhole. No sheens were noted on the water that was being pumped.  Therefore, the gate
valve was opened partially to allow water to slowly enter the retention pond in intervals until no
water remained in the manhole or culvert.  A slight petroleum sheen was noted in the last
remaining amount of water in the manhole. Therefore, before that water entered the pond, the
gate valve was closed and several sections of absorbent boom were moved to the front of the
gate valve to capture any fuel oil that would discharge into the pond.

3.8 NOVEMBER 18, 2014 ACTIVITIES

After the November 17, 2014 rain event ended, on November 18, 2014, Global changed the
absorbent boom in the retention pond that was impacted with fuel oil and soil. They utilized
absorbent pads to collect the fuel oil sheen that was observed to the east of the gate valve and
installed a new boom around the rip rap in the area that had not previously been remediated.
Global also replaced the boom inside the manhole and bagged the impacted booms and pads
which were placed in three 55-gallon drums. An area of diesel-impacted soil that was
approximately 20 feet in length was observed in the southeastern portion of the pond. This area
was previously remediated; however, diesel fuel had migrated to this location most likely during
the November 17, 2014 rain event.

Amec Foster Wheeler contacted Mr. Dino Dellechiaie of the MassDEP to provide an update as
to the sheen that was present in the retention pond and indicated that additional absorbent pads
and booms were used to remove the sheen from the retention pond.  Mr. Dellechiaie advised
Amec Foster Wheeler to collect another sample at the outfall to the other retention pond (#3) to
confirm that no petroleum was leaving retention pond #2. Mr. Dellechiaie also approved a
request by Susan O’Brien, the LSP-of-Record, to increase the soil removal volume to a total of
100 cubic yards.

To evaluate the impacts in the overflow retention pond #3, Amec Foster Wheeler collected a
storm water sample from retention pond #3 at the outfall from retention pond #2.  The sample
was submitted to Alpha for laboratory analysis of EPH plus diesel range target PAHs.  The
analytical results showed that only one EPH fraction was detected above the laboratory
reporting limits, but well below the Method 1 GW-3 standards that were used as a screening
evaluation.  A summary of the analytical results is provided in Table 4. A storm water sample
was also collected on November 12, 2014 (see Section 3.6 above).

3.9 NOVEMBER 20, 2014 ACTIVITIES

On November 20, 2014, Global measured the quantity of fuel and oil that had been collected in
the frac tank.  A total of 1,730 gallons of oil and 4,000 gallons of water were calculated.
Although Global stated that they had previously measured 1,300 gallons of diesel fuel on
November 7, 2014 and 900 gallons of diesel fuel on November 9, 2014 (totaling 2,200 gallons),
this earlier testing had been performed prior to the diesel fuel completely separating from the
water and therefore was deemed to be less accurate than the volume of 1,730 gallons that was
measured on November 20, 2014 within the frac tank.

Global processed the oil/water mixture located in the frac tank through the on-site oil/water
separator. The fuel oil was transported by Global to Tradebe Treatment & Recycling of
Stoughton, Massachusetts on February 19, 2015.

3.10 NOVEMBER 24, 2014 ACTIVITIES

On November 24, 2014, Global mobilized to the Site to inspect the manhole and retention pond
for any sheens due to another small rain event that occurred while the gate valve was left open
to allow water to flow into the retention pond.  Global also replaced the absorbent boom and
pads in front of the gate valve and around an area near the gate valve in the pond and moved
the containment boom closer to this area to contain a minor fuel oil sheen that was observed in
the pond and believed to have originated from the storm water system.

3.11 NOVEMBER 25, 2014 ACTIVITIES

On November 25, 2014, Global replaced the absorbent boom and pads due to a slight fuel oil
sheen present in the small contained area located in front of the gate valve and containerized
the impacted boom and pads.

3.12 NOVEMBER 28, 2014 ACTIVITIES

On November 28, 2014, Global installed additional absorbent pads as needed due to a minor
fuel oil sheen in the small contained area in front of the gate valve and removed and
containerized the impacted pads.  The majority of the pond was frozen and snow covered.

3.13 DECEMBER 3, 2014 ACTIVITIES

On December 3, 2014, Global removed the impacted rip rap in the area to the east of the gate
valve to the top of the storm water.  The soil located below the rip rap in the zone above the
water level appeared to be impacted with diesel fuel based on visual and olfactory observations.
Because the rip rap and soil located below the water was also likely impacted but could not be
accessed, no additional activities were performed in that area.

Fuel oil-impacted soil was also observed on the sides of the retention pond in areas that were
previously remediated.  It was presumed that the impacts were due to snow removal activities at
the facility, whereby plowed snow containing residual petroleum was being disposed of inside
the pond and re-impacting the pond after it melted.  CSX personnel were notified of these
activities which were reportedly ceased.

3.14 DECEMBER 5, 2014 ACTIVITIES

On December 5, 2014, Global installed new rip rap in the area located in front of the gate valve.
No rip rap was installed in areas west of the gate valve where additional impacted soil was in
need of excavation and removal due to the presence of a sheen on top of the rip rap that was
observed by Global.  All areas containing absorbent boom were inspected, resituated, and
replaced, if necessary.

3.15 DECEMBER 11, 2014 ACTIVITIES

On December 11, 2014, Global replaced absorbent booms and pads as needed due to a minor
fuel oil sheen present in the small contained area in front of the gate valve, and removed and
containerized the impacted booms and pads.

3.16 DECEMBER 30, 2014 ACTIVITIES

On December 30, 2014, Amec Foster Wheeler conducted a subsurface investigation south of
track SU2 (between tracks SU2 and SU3) consisting of the advancement of five soil borings,
SB-1 through SB-5, to delineate the extent of the diesel fuel release and determine if diesel fuel
had migrated to and/or affected groundwater.  A soil sample SB-6(0.9”) was also collected to
the north of track SU2 below the ballast and above the impermeable plastic geomembrane liner
between the track and the paved roadway. The borings were initially advanced using a vactor
truck to a depth of five feet bgs, and continued using a track-mounted Geoprobe® push probe
for SB-1, SB-2, and SB-4, which were advanced to depths up to 20 feet. The vactor truck and

Geoprobe® were owned and operated by Geosearch Environmental, Inc. of Fitchburg,
Massachusetts.  Soil samples were collected at one-foot intervals using a hand auger beginning
below the ballast at a depth of one foot to a depth of five feet bgs.

Amec Foster Wheeler was onsite to direct subsurface investigation activities, collect samples for
headspace screening with a PID and/or laboratory analysis, and characterize soil. In addition,
samples were also inspected for visual and olfactory evidence of petroleum contamination. In
general, the overburden was characterized as ballast consisting of one to two inch diameter
angular rocks to a depth ranging from 6 to 12 inches bgs, followed by dry fill material described
as dark brown sand with varying amounts of silt, gravel and cobbles that was encountered to a
depth of approximately nine feet bgs. A clay layer was encountered in SB-1 and SB-4 at a
depth ranging from 9 to 10 feet bgs, followed by a lens of fine to medium sand to the bottom of
each boring.  The water table was encountered at a depth of approximately 12 feet bgs. A soil
sample was collected from soil boring SB-2 at a depth of 11 to 11.5 feet bgs and headspace
screened with a PID (the result was 0.4 ppm) to confirm that diesel fuel had not migrated to the
water table.

When the Geoprobe® was used to advance the soil borings, soil was collected at five-foot
intervals using acetate liners. The soil was logged for lithology. The locations of the soil
borings are shown on Figure 5. The soil boring logs which provide the soil descriptions,
recovery and headspace screening results are provided in Appendix B. After the subsurface
investigation was completed, the borings were backfilled with soil and ballast.

Because the headspace screening results showed a decreasing trend with increasing depth and
because there was no evidence of contamination below a depth of six feet, groundwater was
not likely impacted by the diesel fuel release associated with RTN 2-19355. Therefore, no
groundwater monitoring wells were installed.

For this subsurface investigation, the table below presents the soil boring IDs, the sampling
depth interval, the headspace screening results, and whether the sample was submitted for
laboratory analysis of EPH plus target PAHs.  Since sample SB-5(1-1.5’) exhibited an elevated
headspace reading above 100 ppm, it was also submitted for laboratory analysis of VPH plus
target VOCs.

Based on the headspace screening results, coupled with visual and olfactory observations,
diesel fuel did not appear to have migrated past a depth of six feet bgs.  Therefore, since
groundwater was determined not to be impacted by the release, groundwater monitoring wells
were not installed and groundwater samples were not collected from any of the borings.

The laboratory analytical results revealed that only sample SB-06 exhibited exceedences of
EPH fractions above any of the Method 1 soil standards.  SB-06 was the only sample that was
collected on December 30, 2014 to the north of the tracks between track SU2 and the paved
roadway. It was collected at a depth of 0.9 feet immediately below the ballast and above the
plastic geomembrane liner that was installed between track SU2 and the roadway in that area.
The analytical data for SB-06 revealed that C9-C18 Aliphatics was detected above the Method 1
S-1/GW-3 and S-2/GW-3 standards.  C11-C22 Aliphatics was detected above the S-1/GW-3
standard.  No diesel range target PAHs were detected in SB-06 above any of the Method 1 soil
standards. A summary of the analytical results are provided in Table 3.

The remaining samples were collected from soil borings that were advanced on the south side
of the tracks between tracks SU2 and SU3 in which no plastic geomembrane liner was present
at depths ranging from one to six feet bgs.  Although all three EPH fractions were detected in all
of the eight soil samples collected from the five borings above the laboratory reporting limits,
none were detected above any of the Method 1 soil standards. No diesel range target PAHs
were detected in three samples above the laboratory reporting limits. The remaining five
samples exhibited diesel range target PAH concentrations well below any of the Method 1 soil
standards.

One sample, SB-05(1-1.5’), exhibited a headspace reading above 100 ppm and was therefore
submitted for laboratory analysis of VPH with target VOCs. The analytical results revealed that
all three VPH fractions were detected above the laboratory reporting limits; however, with the
exception of C9-C10 Aromatics, no VPH fractions were detected above any of the Method 1 soil
standards. C9-C10 Aromatics was detected at a concentration of 118 mg/kg, which is slightly
above the Method 1 S-1/GW-3 soil standard of 100 mg/kg.  No target VOCs were detected
above any of the Method 1 soil standards. A summary of the analytical results are provided in
Table 3.

In the three soil borings (SB-02, SB-02, and SB-05) in which two samples were collected for
laboratory analysis of EPH and diesel range target PAHs, a decreasing trend in concentrations

of both EPH fractions and diesel range target PAHs was observed vertically with increasing
depth.

3.17 JANUARY 14, 2015 ACTIVITIES

Due to elevated EPH concentrations from sample SB-06 discussed in the previous section,
further horizontal delineation was required between track SU2 and the paved roadway above
the plastic geomembrane liner. On January 14, 2015, Amec Foster Wheeler collected an
additional three soil samples, SB-7, SB-9 SB-10 immediately above the plastic geomembrane
liner and below the ballast at a depth of 0.9 feet bgs utilizing a shovel and ice pick.  The soil
sample locations are shown on Figure 5. Each sample was headspace screened with a PID for
TVOCs. In addition, soil samples were also inspected for visual and olfactory evidence of
petroleum contamination. The samples were submitted to Alpha for laboratory analysis of EPH
fractions and diesel range target PAHs.

Due to extremely cold temperatures at the time of sample collection, PID readings were not
deemed to be representative of TVOC levels, as the soil was frozen at the time of collection and
was not completely thawed at the time of headspace screening. Therefore, Amec Foster
Wheeler had to rely on visual and olfactory evidence to determine if the horizontal extents of
contamination had been defined.

In general, the soil samples that were collected consisted of fill material comprised of dark
brown sand with varying amounts of silt, gravel and cobbles. The headspace screening results
are provided in the following table:

Soil Sample ID
Headspace
Screening

Result (in ppm)
SB-07 1.2
SB-09 11.3
SB-10 0.4

The laboratory analytical results revealed that no EPH fractions or diesel range target PAHs
were detected in sample SB-07 above the laboratory reporting limits.  No diesel range target
PAHs were detected in sample SB-10 above the laboratory reporting limits.  Two EPH fractions
were detected in sample SB-10 above the laboratory reporting limits but below all of the
Method 1 soil standards.  For sample SB-09, which is located between SB-07 and SB-10, only
one diesel range target PAH was detected above the laboratory reporting limits; this PAH was
detected well below all of the Method 1 soil standards.  All three EPH fractions were detected in
sample SB-09 above the laboratory reporting limits.  Two EPH fractions were detected above at
least one Method 1 soil standards.  C9-C18 Aliphatics was detected above the Method 1
S-1/GW-3 and S-2/GW-3 standards. C11-C22 Aliphatics was detected above the Method 1
S-1/GW-3 standards.  A summary of the soil analytical results are provided in Table 3.

Based on the laboratory analytical results, it was determined that the vertical and horizontal
extents of the diesel fuel release in the locomotive release area were defined and that no
additional sampling or remedial activities were required in this area.

3.18 MAY 12, 2015 ACTIVITIES

On May 12, 2015, Amec Foster Wheeler personnel performed soil headspace screening using a
PID in all areas of the pond that were previously believed to have been re-impacted, as
described in Section 3.13 above, including the sides of the pond and the area located east of
the gate valve below the previous standing water. These areas were also investigated for visual
and olfactory evidence of contamination. Additional areas, including the bottom of the pond,
were also investigated and soil samples were collected from these areas and headspace
screened with a PID. With the exception of the area located west of the gate valve (see Section
3.19 below), no elevated headspace readings (above 5 ppm), visual staining or olfactory
evidence of contamination were noted in any areas of the pond.

3.19 MAY 13, 2015 ACTIVITIES

Due to the presence of standing water in the retention pond beginning in mid-November 2014,
as well as significant snowfall events beginning in mid-January 2015, the final remediation in
retention pond #2 to the west of the gate valve was postponed until the snow melted and the
water in the pond evaporated.

On May 13, 2015, Global and Amec Foster Wheeler mobilized to the retention pond.  Global
used shovels, a skid-steer loader and a mini-excavator to remove approximately four cubic
yards of diesel fuel impacted rip-rap and soil from around that area located to the west of the
gate valve area.  The removal of the impacted material was based on headspace screening
results, as well as visual and olfactory evidence of contamination as directed by Amec Foster
Wheeler.

Prior to conducting the remediation, Global removed the absorbent booms located in the
following areas: 1) on the side of the gate valve, 2) inside the hard boom surrounding the gate
valve and 3) next to the culvert.  The booms were placed in cubic yard boxes for disposal.
Global also temporarily removed the hard boom to perform the remediation.

After the excavation was completed, the dimensions of the excavation were 9 feet long by
5.3 feet wide by 2.5 feet deep (from the bottom of the rip rap). As shown on the inset in
Figure 4, a total of four sidewall samples (Sidewall-01(W) through Sidewall-04(W)) and one
bottom sample (Bott-01(W)) were collected for headspace screening and laboratory analysis.
The sidewall samples were collected approximately 0.5 feet above the bottom of the excavation.
As indicated on Table 2, the highest headspace screening result was 1.3 ppm.  The samples
from these locations were submitted to Alpha for laboratory analysis of EPH fractions and diesel
range target PAHs.

The analytical results showed that no EPH fractions or diesel range target PAH analytes were
detected in Sidewall-02(W) and Bott-01(W) above the laboratory reporting limits.  No target
PAHs were detected in any of the five samples above the laboratory reporting limits.  Low
concentrations of EPH fractions were detected in the remaining samples well below the strictest
Method 1 S-1/GW-3 standards.  A summary of the analytical results is provided in Table 2.

Global placed the excavated soil directly into a metal roll-off container and on May 20, 2015
transported it to ESMI of Loudon, New Hampshire for thermal treatment under a Bill of Lading.

Prior to leaving the Site for the day, Global placed absorbent booms around the outside the gate
valve to absorb any diesel fuel which may be discharged from the concrete culvert during a
minor rainfall event. The hard boom was replaced around the gate valve area.

3.20 JUNE 2, 2015 ACTIVITIES

A major rainfall event began on the evening of May 31, 2015 and continued through June 2,
2015.  On the morning of June 1, 2015, Amec Foster Wheeler visited the Site and observed a
petroleum odor and visible sheen on top of the water to the west of the gate valve area.  The
sheen was contained within the hard boom that had been placed around the gate valve area.

On June 2, 2015, Global mobilized to the retention pond to capture the sheen using absorbent
pads.  They also installed a ten foot section of absorbent boom in the area where the impacts
were originating.  Additionally, they placed an absorbent boom on the inside of the hard boom.

3.21 JUNE 19, 2015 ACTIVITIES

Prior to another major rainfall event which occurred on June 20 and 21, 2015, Global mobilized
to the retention pond to change the absorbent booms and reset the hard boom. No signs of a
sheen or odor were observed by Global at that time.

3.22 JUNE 29, 2015 ACTIVITIES

Global reinstalled stakes that were used to position the outside absorbent and hard boom, since
the western side of the booms had become loose and had shifted inside of the stakes due to a
major rainfall event on June 27 and 28, 2015 which caused the water in the pond to be higher
than expected.  No signs of a sheen or odor were noted by Global when they reinstalled the
stakes and repositioned the booms.

3.23 SEPTEMBER 11, 2015 ACTIVITIES

A major rain event occurred overnight and on the morning of September 11, 2015, producing a
sheen in the retention pond which was observed inside the inner absorbent boom between the
gate valve and the boom. In addition, the innermost absorbent boom and the absorbent booms
located left and right of the gate valve were black in color and needed to be replaced. Therefore,
in the early afternoon of September 11, 2015, after the rain event had subsided, Global
mobilized to the Site and initially used absorbent pads to soak up the sheen.  They then
removed and replaced the impacted absorbent booms in front of the gate valve and to the
immediate left and right of the gate valve. As an added precaution, they also installed one
section of absorbent boom inside the manhole that leads to the gate valve and the pond with the
intention of absorbing any petroleum prior to reaching the gate valve and retention pond.

3.24 SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 AND OCTOBER 1, 2015 ACTIVITIES

A significant rain event occurred during the day on September 30, 2015.  Amec Foster Wheeler
visited the Site on the late afternoon of September 30, 2015 and did not observe the presence
of a sheen.  However, Global mobilized to the Site on the morning of October 1, 2015 after the
rain event had subsided to inspect the absorbent booms. Because the booms were either
damaged and deteriorated or covered in dirt, mud, and/or oil, they were all replaced, including
the booms located in front of and to the sides of the gate valve, as well as the absorbent boom

located further out from the gate valve adjacent to the hard boom.  The removed booms were
bagged, containerized in a cubic yard box and stored onsite.

3.25 OCTOBER 28 AND 29, 2015 ACTIVITIES

A major rain event occurred in the evening of October 28, 2015 and continued until the early
morning of October 29, 2015. Amec Forster Wheeler visited the Site in the morning of October
29, 2015 and did not observe the presence of a sheen.  In addition, the booms appeared
relatively clean. Global mobilized to the Site to permanently remove the outer absorbent and
hard booms from the pond since they were not needed as sheens or oil impacts were no longer
being observed. The absorbent booms located near the gate valve will temporarily remain in
place, as they were still deemed to be effective in absorbing debris discharging from the
concrete culvert into the pond and are hence temporarily being incorporated into the storm
water management practices at the facility. They will be removed in January 2016 or
immediately prior to the first major snowfall event.

4.0 CRITICAL EXPOSURE PATHWAY, SUBSTANTIAL RELEASE MIGRATION, AND
IMMINENT HAZARD EVALUATIONS

4.1 CRITICAL EXPOSURE PATHWAY EVALUATION

Critical Exposure Pathways (CEPs) are defined by the MCP as routes by which OHM released
at a site are transported or are likely to be transported to human receptors via:

 vapor-phase emissions of measurable concentrations of OHM into the living or working
space of a pre-school, daycare, school or occupied residential dwelling; or

 ingestion, dermal absorption or inhalation of measureable concentrations of OHM from
drinking water supply wells located at and servicing a pre-school, daycare, school or
occupied residential dwelling.

A CEP does not exist for the ingestion, dermal absorption, or inhalation or OHM from a drinking
water supply well because the Site is not located in a Current or Potential Drinking Water
Source Area nor are there any private water supply wells located at or in the vicinity of the Site.
A CEP does not exist for the vapor-phase emissions of measureable concentrations of OHM
into the living or working space of a pre-school, daycare, school or occupied residential dwelling
as the release was confined to limited areas which were remediated. Currently the closest pre-
school, daycare or dwelling is a residence located approximately 650 feet southeast of the
retention pond #2 area and a residence located 500 feet northwest of the locomotive release
area.

4.2 CONDITION OF SUBSTANTIAL RELEASE MIGRATION EVALUATION

Pursuant to 310 CMR 40.0006 and 40.0313(4), a Condition of Substantial Release Migration
(SRM) is defined by any of the following criteria.  An evaluation of the applicability or relevance
of each criterion to the Site conditions is given below.

1. Releases that have resulted in the discharge of separate-phase OHM to surface
waters, buildings, or underground utilities or conduits.

The majority of the release was directed to the recently constructed on-site subsurface
storm water drainage system which directed the diesel fuel to retention pond #2.
However, the diesel fuel that discharged to the pond was contained within the pond and
was removed by Global, along with associated diesel impacted peastone, rip rap and
soil.

2. Releases to the ground surface or to the vadose zone that if not promptly
removed or contained are likely to significantly impact the underlying
groundwater or significantly exacerbate an existing condition of groundwater
pollution.

An impermeable plastic geomembrane liner is located beneath and to the north of the
track SU2 and directs contamination to the underground storm water system.  A
subsurface investigation was performed on December 30, 2014 to evaluate the extent of
contamination to the south of the track SU2. The laboratory analytical results indicated
that the release did not significantly impact soil past a depth of approximately two feet

bgs. Since groundwater in the locomotive release area is located at a depth of
approximately 12 feet bgs in the location of the locomotive release area, it was not likely
affected by the release associated with RTN 2-19355. All impacted soil was excavated
and removed from retention pond #2 and groundwater was not encountered in the
bottoms of the excavations. Therefore, groundwater in the retention pond #2 area was
not likely affected by the release associated with RTN 2-19355.

3. Releases to the groundwater that have migrated or are expected to migrate
more than 200 feet per year.

Based on the results of the December 30, 2014 subsurface investigation in the
locomotive release area and the results of the samples collected from the bottoms of the
excavations located in the retention pond #2 area, the release associated with RTN
2-19355 did not likely migrate to groundwater; therefore, this criterion is not applicable to
the Site.

4. Releases to the groundwater that have been or are within one year likely to be
detected in a public or private water supply well.

Based on the results of the December 30, 2014 subsurface investigation in the
locomotive release area and the results of the samples collected from the bottoms of the
excavations located in the retention pond #2 area, the release associated with RTN
2-19355 did not likely migrate to groundwater; therefore, this criterion is not applicable to
the Site. In addition, no public or private water supply wells are located in the vicinity of
the Site.

5. Releases to the groundwater that have been or within one year are likely to be
detected in a surface water body, wetland, or public water supply reservoir.

Based on the results of the December 30, 2014 subsurface investigation in the
locomotive release area and the results of the samples collected from the bottoms of the
excavations located in the retention pond #2 area, the release associated with RTN
2-19355 did not likely migrate to groundwater; therefore, this criterion is not applicable to
the Site. In addition, no surface water bodies, wetlands or public water supply reservoirs
are located in the vicinity of the Site.

6. Release to the groundwater or to the vadose zone that have resulted or have
the potential to result in the discharge of vapors into a school, daycare or child
care center or occupied residential dwelling.

No schools, daycares, child care centers or residential dwellings are located in the
vicinity of the Site and groundwater was not impacted from the release associated with
RTN 2-19355. Therefore, the petroleum release at the Site is not expected to result in
the discharge of vapors into school buildings, daycares, child care centers or occupied
residential dwellings.

Based on the above information, Amec Foster Wheeler concludes that a Condition of
Substantial Release Migration, as defined by the MCP, does not exist at the Site.

4.3 IMMINENT HAZARD EVALUATION

As defined by the MCP, the focus of an Imminent Hazard Evaluation shall be on actual or likely
exposures to human and environmental receptors under current Site conditions, considering the
current use of the Site and the surrounding environment. An Imminent Hazard does not exist at
the Site for the following reasons:

 The release did not result in the presence of vapors within buildings, structures, or
underground utility conduits at a concentration equal to or greater than 10% of the Lower
Explosive Limit;

 The release did not endanger public safety within a roadway;

 The release did not pose a significant risk to human health when present at the Site for a
short period of time;

 The release did not represent a condition that was reactive or explosive and did not
threaten human health or safety;

 The release did not produce immediate or acute adverse impacts to freshwater or
saltwater fish populations;

 The release did not produce readily apparent effects to human health, including
respiratory distress or dermal irritation;

 No private drinking water supply wells are located within 500 feet of the Site; therefore, it
is highly unlikely that the release would impact a private drinking water supply well at
concentrations ten times the MCP GW-1 Reportable Concentration;

 The diesel impacted soil in the area of the release is covered with stone ballast and is not
readily accessible; and,

 The release did not represent long-term risk levels associated with current exposures that
are greater than ten times the Cumulative Receptor Risk Limits in 310 CMR 40.0993(6).

Based on this information, Amec Foster Wheeler concludes that an imminent hazard, as defined
by the MCP, does not exist at the Site.

4.4 IRA COMPLETION STATEMENT

The IRA was completed in accordance with 310 CMR 40.0427 via the removal of the petroleum
impacted soil and ballast located in retention pond #2, as well as the removal of product and
oil/water located in the subsurface concrete culvert and retention pond #2. It is the opinion of
Amec Foster Wheeler that the IRA associated with RTN 2-19355 is complete, as the IRA was
successful in stabilizing Site conditions and, as discussed below in Section 5, achieved a
condition of No Significant Risk.

5.0 CONCEPTUAL SITE MODEL, NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, AND
POTENTIAL RECEPTORS

The conceptual site model is a three dimensional picture of site conditions that illustrates
contaminant distribution, release mechanisms, exposure pathways, migration routes and
potential receptors.  The purpose of the conceptual site model is to present an understanding of
known and suspect environmental conditions as they currently exist for the Site.  The
conceptual site model also provides a basis for evaluating the need for implementing additional
remedial actions.  The conceptual site model is detailed below.

5.1 CONTAMINANTS OF CONCERN

Diesel fuel, a petroleum product, is the contaminant that was released onto the ground surface
at the Site. Diesel fuel is a mixture of numerous hydrocarbon compounds; the composition is
complex and variable and a function of:  1) the origin and chemistry of the parent crude oil,
2) the refining and blending processes, and 3) the use of performance-enhancing additives.
Diesel fuel consists of a complex mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons.  The aliphatic
alkanes and cycloalkanes such as naphthalenes are hydrogen saturated and comprise
approximately 80 to 90 percent of fuel oils.  Aromatics comprise between 10 to 20 percent of
fuel oils. Diesel fuel is a distillate fuel which consists of distilled process streams and is usually
a blended distillate with hydrocarbons in the in the C11 to C20 range.

As per the MassDEP guidance document entitled: “Characterizing Risks Posed by Petroleum
Contaminated Sites: Implementation of the MADEP VPH/EPH Approach”, Policy No.
WSC-02-411, dated October 31, 2002, the recommended target analyte list for the diesel fuel
that was released to soil when headspace readings are over 100 ppm consists of benzene,
toluene, ethyl benzene, xylenes (BTEX) and naphthalene (target VOCs).  The recommended
target analyte list for soil when headspace readings are less than 100 ppm is acenaphthene,
2-methylnaphthalene, naphthalene and phenanthrene (fuel oil range target PAHs). BTEX are
considered VOCs and are known to readily volatilize to the air. Acenaphthene,
2-methylnaphthalene, and phenanthrene are considered PAHs, a subset of semi-volatile
organic compounds (SVOCs), which are heavier and less volatile than VOCs.  Naphthalene is
an intermediate between a VOC and PAH, and is therefore considered an analyte in both
categories.

During the remedial activities that occurred in retention pond #2, all of the headspace readings
for all the post-excavation confirmatory soil samples were less than 100 ppm; therefore, no
samples in that area were submitted for laboratory analysis of VPH fractions with target VOCs.
In the locomotive release area in the vicinity of track SU2, two soil samples (Testpit-02 and
SB-05(1-1.5’)) exhibited headspace readings near or above 100 ppm; those samples were
submitted for laboratory analysis of VPH fractions with target VOCs.

For the retention pond #2 area, a total of 29 post-excavation confirmatory soil samples were
submitted for laboratory analysis of EPH fractions with diesel range target PAHs. The
29 samples include 16 samples collected from the sides of the retention pond, as well as five
samples collected from east of the gate valve excavation area, five samples collected from west
of the gate valve excavation area and three samples collected from the culvert excavation area.
The laboratory results for all 29 post-excavation confirmatory samples revealed that no EPH
fractions or diesel range target PAHs were detected above any of the Method 1 standards.

In the locomotive release area, a total of 14 soil samples were submitted for laboratory analysis
of EPH fractions with diesel range target PAHs.  The sample set include two samples that were
collected from two test pits (Testpit-01 and Testpit-02) which were excavated between tracks
SU2 and SU3 at a depth of two feet approximately one week after the release occurred. The
sample set also consisted of eight soil samples that were collected from five soil borings (SB-01
through SB-05) that were advanced on December 30, 2014 between tracks SU2 and SU3; the
sample depths ranged from one to six feet bgs. In addition, four soil samples (SB-06 through
SB-10) were collected on January 14, 2015 at a depth of 0.9 feet bgs immediately above the
impermeable plastic geomembrane liner that had previously been installed as part of site
improvements to the north of track SU2 between the track and the paved roadway. The
laboratory results revealed one VPH fraction, C9-C10 Aromatics, was detected above the
Method 1 S-1/GW-3 standard in both of the samples that were submitted for VPH analysis.  The
results were below the applicable Method 1 S-2/GW-3 standards.  In addition, for the EPH
fraction C9-C18 Aliphatics, three samples (Testpit-02, SB-06, and SB-09) were detected above
the Method 1 S-1/GW-3 standard; two samples (SB-06 and SB-09) were also detected above
the applicable Method 1 S-2/GW-3 standard.  In addition, one EPH fraction, C11-C22
Aromatics, was detected in two samples (SB-06 and SB-09) above the Method 1 S-1/GW-3
standard.

In November 2014, two storm water samples were also collected from retention pond #3 which
overflows from retention pond #2 to determine if diesel fuel from the release was migrating to
retention pond #3.  The samples were submitted for laboratory analysis of EPH fractions plus
diesel range target PAHs. Only one EPH fraction, C19-C36 Aliphatics, was detected in each
sample at concentrations of 104 and 327 µg/l, slightly above the laboratory reporting limit of 100
µg/l, but well below the Method 1 GW-3 groundwater standard of 50,000 µg/l (this standard was
used for screening purposes only).  Based on these results, it was determined that since the
concentrations were near background, there was no migration of diesel fuel from retention pond
#2 to retention pond #3.

MassDEP’s “Guidance for Disposal Site Risk Characterization” (WSC/ORS-95-141) was used
as a reference in considering which analytes would be selected as Contaminants of Concern.
In accordance with this document, each detected analyte should be considered a Contaminant
of Concern unless one of the following conditions is true:

 The analytes are present at a low frequency of detection and in low concentration;

 The analytes are present at levels that are consistent with “background” concentrations
for the area and there is no evidence that their presence is related to activities at the
Site; or

 The chemical are field or laboratory contaminants.

Based on this guidance document, the Contaminants of Concern in soil are all three VPH
fractions, the target VOCs consisting of ethyl benzene, xylenes, and toluene, all three EPH
fractions and three diesel range target PAH compounds consisting of acenaphthene,
2-methylnaphthalene and phenanthrene, as well as naphthalene which is considered an
intermediate between a VOC and PAH.

Based on the December 30, 2014 subsurface investigation performed in the locomotive release
area, groundwater in that area is located at a depth of approximately 12 feet bgs. In the
retention pond #2 area, the depth to groundwater is unknown; however, it is located at a depth

Page 27

of at least three feet below the bottom of the pond, since excavation activities were conducted in
that area and groundwater was not encountered. Since the headspace readings and soil
laboratory analytical results in both locations showed no indications of soil impacts in the
vadose zone above the water table, the release did not migrate to groundwater and
groundwater was therefore not evaluated.

5.2 PRIMARY RELEASE MECHANISM/SOURCE OF OHM

The primary release mechanism is a release of diesel fuel to the ground surface via a
compromised filter canister clamp located on the engine of the locomotive which caused a rapid
release of diesel fuel onto the surrounding ballast and pavement. After being released into the
ballast, the diesel fuel migrated on top of an impermeable geomembrane liner that was present
below the ballast on the northern side of track SU2.  The liner was sloped downward so that the
diesel fuel was directed through the ballast to a subsurface concrete conduit that is 30 inches in
diameter which discharged to unlined retention pond #2.

5.3 NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION

5.3.1 Soil

The release affected two areas at the Site consisting of the location where the release occurred,
referred to as the locomotive release area, and retention pond #2, where the release ultimately
discharged.

In the locomotive release area, the horizontal extent of contamination is defined as follows:

 to the south of track SU2 between tracks SU2 and SU3 with the collection of sample(s)
from boring SB-04 to the west, SB-05 to the southwest, SB-02 to the southeast and
SB-03 to the east;

 to the north of track SU2 with the collection of sample SB-07 to the west and SB-10 to
the east.

In the locomotive release area, the vertical extent of contamination is defined to the south of
track SU2 between tracks SU2 and SU3 with the collection of samples SB-01(5-6’), SB-02(4-5’),
and SB-05(3-3.5’). Because of the presence of the impermeable plastic geomembrane liner to
the north of track SU2, the release did not migrate below the liner which is located at a depth of
0.9 feet.

At retention pond #2, the horizontal and vertical extents of contamination at the sidewalls are
defined with the collection of confirmatory samples RP-1 to RP-16 that were collected along the
northern, eastern and southern sidewalls of the pond at distances ranging from every 10 to
20 feet at depths ranging from 4 to 13 inches bgs. In the area located east of the gate valve,
the horizontal extent of contamination is defined with the collection of four confirmatory sidewall
samples, Sidewall-01 through Sidewall-04; the vertical extent of contamination is defined with
the collection of one confirmatory bottom sample, Bot-01, that was collected from a depth of
three feet bgs. In the area located west of the gate valve, the horizontal extent of contamination
is defined with the collection of four confirmatory sidewall samples, Sidewall-01(W) through
Sidewall-04(W); the vertical extent of contamination is defined with the collection of one
confirmatory bottom sample, Bott-01(W), that was collected from a depth of 2.5 feet bgs.  In

the culvert area, the horizontal extent of contamination is defined with the collection of two
confirmatory soil samples, Culvert-01 and Culvert-02-Top; the vertical extent of contamination is
defined with the collection of one confirmatory bottom sample, Culvert-02-Bot, that was
collected from a depth of two feet bgs.

5.3.2 Groundwater

Groundwater was not affected by the release, as soil impacts did not extend past six feet bgs in
the locomotive release and the water table is located at a depth of approximately 12 feet bgs.
The depth to the water table below the bottom of retention pond #2 is unknown; however, the
retention pond was dry during soil excavation activities and groundwater was not encountered
after excavation activities were completed in the lowest areas of the pond, consisting of the
areas located east and west of the gate valves, as well as the culvert area.

5.3.3 Surface Water

The nearest off-site surface water body is located approximately 3,000 feet north of the Site.
The on-site storm water retention ponds located at the Site were constructed in 2012.  No storm
water from the ponds is discharged off-site.  Retention pond #2 is often dry when there are no
rainfall events for any extended period of time. The release did not migrate off-site via
subsurface structures, catch basins or storm drains.  Therefore, off-site surface water was not
likely impacted by the Site release.

Since retention pond #2 does not support or provide habitat for aquatic organisms or wildlife and
is not integrated into the natural landscape and local hydrogeologic system, it is not considered
a surface water body (See Section 5.5 below).

5.3.4 Indoor Air

No buildings are located within the vicinity of the release areas. The nearest occupied building
to retention pond #2 is the CSX office which is located approximately 600 feet to the west.  The
nearest occupied building to the locomotive release area is a commercial building located 250
feet to the north. In addition, based on the low concentrations of VPH and EPH fractions
remaining in soil, it is the opinion of Amec Foster Wheeler that volatilization of diesel fuel
constituents to indoor air is not an exposure pathway of concern at the Site.

5.4.1 Underground Utilities

Except for the underground concrete culvert which was constructed to carry storm water and
releases to the retention pond, underground utilities were not present within the Disposal Site
Boundaries.  In addition, groundwater was not affected by the release. Therefore, no
preferential pathways with respect to underground utilities or conduits exist as a result of this
release.

5.4 HUMAN RECEPTORS POTENTIAL

5.4.1 Residents

The Site is currently utilized as a CSX rail yard.  Currently, child/adult residents are not typically
present within the boundaries of the Site; however, child/adult residents are present with the

Permanent Solution Statement With Conditions

Release Tracking Number 2-19355
November 2015

Page 29

immediate vicinity of the Site as the Site is located in a mixed commercial, industrial and
residential area of Worcester, Massachusetts.  Under unrestricted future uses of the Site,
child/adult residents may be present within the boundaries of the Site.  Exposure pathways to
Site Contaminants of Concern in soil for residential receptors would potentially include dermal
contact, incidental ingestion and inhalation/ingestion of particulate matter derived from Site soil.
For groundwater, the potential exposure pathways for residential receptors would include
dermal contact with and inhalation of vapors derived from groundwater. However, because the
Site is located in a railroad right-of-way on a property that will remain a rail yard for the
foreseeable future, the presence of child/adult residents within the Disposal Site Boundary is not
expected in the future.

5.4.2 Site Workers/Site Visitors

Site visitors (primarily adults) and/or employees (adults) are present under current activities and
are likely to be present at the Site under future foreseeable non-residential uses and activities.
Exposure pathways to Site Contaminants of Concern in soil for site workers/site visitors include
dermal contact, incidental ingestion and inhalation/ingestion of particulate matter derived from
Site soil.  There are no potential groundwater exposure pathways for these receptors as
groundwater was not impacted and is not used for drinking water in the vicinity of the Site.

5.4.3 Utility and Construction Workers

Utility and construction workers are not likely to be present at the Site under current activities,
since the Site is being used as a rail yard and construction/utility work is not likely to occur.
Under the foreseeable future Site uses, utility and construction workers may be present for
maintenance or installation, construction and/or updating of existing utilities or structures. The
primary exposure pathways to Contaminants of Concern in soil for these receptors would
include dermal contact, incidental ingestion of and inhalation/ingestion of particulate matter
derived from Site soil.  Additionally, based on the depth to groundwater of 12 feet bgs in the
locomotive release area and the average burial depth of underground utilities (approximately
3 to 8 feet bgs), utility and construction workers are not likely to come into contact with
groundwater beneath the Site which was not impacted from the release associated with RTN
2-19355.

5.4.4 Trespassers/Passersby

Trespassers and passersby are not likely to be present at the Site under current and
foreseeable future Site conditions, as the entire CSX facility is secured with a fence and locked
gates.

5.5 ENVIRONMENTAL RECEPTORS

According to the MassDEP Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup Phase I Site Assessment Map, the
Site is located greater than one-half mile from areas designated as Areas of Critical
Environmental Concern (ACEC), rare wetland wildlife habitats, wetland areas, and certified and
potential vernal pools. Given the urban nature of the Site and surrounding properties, exposures
to wildlife in the vicinity of the Site are not expected to occur.

Storm water retention pond #2 is one of four man-made basins that were constructed within the
rail yard to manage storm water.  The bottom of retention pond #2 consists of soil and is often

dry.  Therefore, no aquatic habitats, including aquatic vegetation, are present within retention
pond #2.  Based on this information, no environmental receptors are present within storm water
retention pond #2 and it does not represent an ecological resource (MassDEP, 2006). Since
retention pond #2 does not support or provide habitat for aquatic organisms or wildlife and is not
integrated into the natural landscape and local hydrogeologic system, it does not need to be
evaluated in the risk characterization.

6.0 METHOD 1 RISK CHARACTERIZATION

6.1 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

The characterization of risk of harm to health, safety, public welfare and the environment is
required at the Site because the contamination in soil has not been reduced to background
levels, as described in 310 CMR 40.1020 of the MCP. A Method 1 risk characterization was
used to assess risk to human health, public welfare, and the environment at the Site.  The
Method 1 risk characterization was performed in a manner consistent with scientifically
acceptable risk assessment practices and using MassDEP guidance.

The risk characterization uses quantitative and qualitative information to evaluate the need for
additional remedial actions by establishing whether a Condition of No Significant Risk of harm to
health, safety, public welfare and the environment exists at the Site.  The result of risk
characterization is a basis for selection of an appropriate category for closure (i.e. a Permanent
Solution Statement with No Conditions, a Permanent Solution Statement with Conditions, or a
Temporary Solution).

As per 310 CMR 40.0191 of the MCP, the scope of the risk characterization is commensurate
with the complexity of the Site and is sufficient to demonstrate that the Response Action
Performance Standard (RAPS) has been met.  RAPS, as it applies to risk characterization, is
the level of diligence reasonably necessary to obtain the quantity and quality of information
adequate to evaluate whether a Condition of No Significant Risk for any foreseeable period of
time has been achieved.  The employment of RAPS incorporates consideration of relevant
policies and guidelines issued by MassDEP and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and the use of accurate and up-to-date methods, standards, and practices.

6.2 RISK CHARACTERIZATION METHOD

As stated above, a Method 1 risk characterization approach was used to assess risk of harm to
health, safety, public welfare and the environment at the Site. The Method 1 risk
characterization compares contaminant concentrations detected at the Site to promulgated lists
of soil and groundwater standards.  It was performed in a manner consistent with scientifically
acceptable risk assessment practices and MassDEP guidance and was appropriate to evaluate
risk of harm to health, safety, public welfare and the environment at the Site for the following
reasons:

 Soil was determined to be the only affected media;

 There is no potential for volatilization to indoor air;

 There are no analytes which bioaccumulate within the top two feet of soil; and

 There was no non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) detected in soil or groundwater at the
Site.

The Method 1 risk characterization was performed in accordance with 310 CMR 40.0970 of the
MCP and the MassDEP guidance document entitled “Guidance for Disposal Site Risk
Characterization in Support of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan” dated July 1995.  The
required MCP components of the risk characterization are presented in this section of the report
and include the following:

Page 32

 Current and reasonably foreseeable site activity and use identified pursuant to 310 CMR
40.0923;

 Soil categories determined for the Site identified pursuant to 310 CMR 40.0933;

 Exposure Point(s) in soil for all current and reasonably foreseeable Site activities and
Uses identified pursuant to 310 CMR 40.0924;

 Exposure Point Concentrations as described in 310 CMR 40.0926; and

 Comparison of Exposure Point Concentrations to the appropriate MCP Method 1
standard listed in 310 CMR 40.0975.

A separate evaluation of risk of harm to safety was completed in accordance with 310 CMR
40.0960.

As discussed in Section 5.1 of this report, the Contaminants of Concern for soil at the Site are
all three VPH fractions, the target VOCs consisting of ethyl benzene, xylenes and toluene, all
three EPH fractions and three diesel range target PAH compounds consisting of acenaphthene,
2-methylnaphthalene and phenanthrene, as well as naphthalene which is considered an
intermediate between a VOC and PAH. There are two separate exposure points at the Site
consisting of the locomotive release area and the retention pond #2 area.  The Contaminants of
Concern in the locomotive release area are the three VPH fractions, the target VOCs consisting
of ethyl benzene, xylenes and toluene, the three EPH fractions, and two diesel range target
PAHs consisting of 2-methylnaphthalene and phenanthrene, as well as naphthalene which is an
intermediate between a VOC and PAH.  The Contaminants of Concern in the retention pond #2
area consists of the three EPH fractions and all four diesel range target PAHs consisting of
acenaphthene, naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene and phenanthrene. Because of the low
headspace screening results for the confirmatory samples collected in the retention pond area,
no samples were collected for VPH and target VOC analysis.

There are no Contaminants of Concern for groundwater at the Site, as groundwater was not
impacted.

6.3 CURRENT AND FORESEEABLE ACTIVITIES AND USES

The property comprising the Site is an active CSX rail yard. Container cargo is brought to the
CSX facility via rail and transferred to trucks for off-site distribution.  Except for the four on-site
storm water retention ponds, the CSX facility is either paved or covered by railroad tracks and
associated ballast and buildings.  The entire facility is secured by fencing and locked gates.
The planned future use is also expected to be the same; however, unrestricted future expansion
of the current commercial operations, as well as use of the Site for other commercial, residential
or institutional use is not precluded from consideration in the Method 1 risk characterization.
Because the Site is located in a rail right-of-way, an Activity and Use Limitation is not required
per 310 CMR 40.1013(1)(c) of the MCP.

6.4 METHOD 1 SOIL AND GROUNDWATER CATEGORIES

As previously discussed in Sections 2.7, soil at the Site is categorized based on:

 Current and future potential receptors;



Immediate Response Action Completion Report and
Permanent Solution Statement With Conditions
CSX Intermodal Terminal
271 Franklin Street, Worcester, Massachusetts
Release Tracking Number 2-19355
November 2015

Page 33

 Frequency of use and intensity of activities; and

 Accessibility of the soils.

The soil categories consider ingestion and dermal contact with the soil. All of the soil is
considered “accessible” since it is either located below ballast in the locomotive release area or
at the unlined retention pond and the Method 1 S-2 category applies at a depth of 0 to 3 feet
bgs. The Method 1 S-3 category applies for soil located under pavement or at a depth greater
than 3 feet bgs. For unrestricted future use, soil will also be compared to the Method 1 S-1 soil
category.  Any exposure point concentrations that are above the Method 1 S-1 standards, if not
located within a right-of-way, would require the implementation of an Activity and Use Limitation.
However, as per 310 CMR 40.1013(1)(c) of the MCP, releases that are located within a railroad
right-of-way would not require an Activity and Use Limitation.

As discussed in Section 2.8, groundwater is categorized based on its potential:

 for human consumption;

 to act as a source of VOCs to inhalation of indoor air; and

 to affect the aquatic environment after discharge to surface water.

GW-1 category is not applicable as the Site is not located within a current or potential drinking
water source area or a municipal aquifer protection district and private potable wells are not
located within the vicinity of the Site.

The GW-2 category is not applicable to the Site.  This category which considers groundwater as
a potential source of vapors to indoor air, applies to groundwater that is located within 30 feet of
an existing or planned building or structure that is or will be occupied and the average annual
depth to groundwater in that area is 15 feet or less.  The depth to groundwater at the Site is less
than 15 feet bgs. However, since the Site is located within an active rail yard, no planned or
current buildings are located in proximity to the Site. The nearest occupied building is the CSX
office which is located approximately 600 feet west of Retention Pond #2 and 250 feet north of
the locomotive release area.

All groundwater is considered a potential source of discharge to surface water and is therefore
classified as GW-3.

6.5 HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

The nature of contamination is diesel fuel.  The extent of contamination is adequately defined
with the number and location of samples, augmented with the Site history information.

Two separate exposure points are being evaluated at the Site since two separate areas were
affected.  The exposure points are referred to as the “locomotive release area” and “retention
pond #2” and are discussed below.

For the locomotive release area, as shown on Figure 5, a total of 14 samples were collected for
laboratory analysis of EPH fractions with diesel range target PAH compounds. Two of these
samples were also submitted for laboratory analysis of VPH fractions with target VOCs. These
samples are being used to evaluate the extent of contamination both below the ballast to the
south of railroad track SU2 and above the plastic geomembrane liner to the north of track SU2.

Page 34

Since impermeable matting was present between track SU2, that area was not affected by the
diesel fuel release. Other than placing Speedy-dri® above the pavement to the north of track
SU2, no remediation activities occurred in the locomotive release area. The samples collected
in this area are considered representative of current Site conditions.

For the retention pond #2 area, as shown on Figure 4, a total of 29 post-excavation
confirmatory samples were collected for laboratory analysis of EPH fractions with diesel range
target PAH compounds. Of these samples, 16 samples were collected from the sides of the
retention pond; five samples were collected from each side of the gate valve area, and three
samples were collected from the culvert area. These samples are being used to evaluate the
extent of contamination after soil excavation activities were completed on three sides of the
retention pond, as well as on each side of the gate valve and in the culvert area.

Each soil sample was screened for headspace analysis prior to being submitted for laboratory
analysis. Details of the screening and sampling events are provided in Section 3 of the report.
Tables 1 through 3 provide a summary of the headspace screening and soil sampling results.

6.6 EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT

6.6.1 Identification of Potential Human Receptors

The potential human receptors were identified in Section 5.4 of this report. Site workers, visitors,
utility workers and construction workers could be potentially exposed to soil contamination as a
result of dermal contact, incidental ingestion of and inhalation/ingestion of particulate matter
derived from Site soil.

The Site is not located within a current or potential drinking water source.  Given that the Site is
located in a developed area and there is access to municipal potable water, no private potable
wells will likely be installed.  In addition, groundwater was not impacted by the release
associated with RTN 2-19355.

Since diesel fuel has ceased migrating into the retention pond, there is no longer any potential
for human exposure with storm water.

6.6.2 Identification of Potential Environmental Receptors

The Site provides a limited habitat for terrestrial species based on its use as a rail yard located
in a developed urban area. As described previously, part of the disposal site consists of a man-
made storm water retention pond, referred to as retention pond #2.  The impacted storm water
retention pond is one of four man-made basins as part of the rail yard constructed to manage
storm water. The bottom of retention pond #2 consists of soil and is often dry.  Therefore, no
aquatic habitats, including aquatic vegetation, are present within retention pond #2.  Based on
this information, the storm water retention pond does not represent an ecological resource
(MassDEP, 2006).

Method 1 GW-3 standards were developed to be protective of aquatic environmental receptors
following the eventual discharge of groundwater to surface water bodies. The nearest surface
water body is located approximately 3,000 feet north of the Site and groundwater was not
affected by the release associated with RTN 2-19355. Therefore, there is no risk to ecological
receptors in a surface water body.

6.6.3 Identification of Potential Exposure Points and Exposure Point Concentrations (EPCs)

This section contains information on exposure points and how EPCs have been established.
EPCs for the Site Contaminants of Concern are estimates of the concentrations of each
Contaminant of Concern in the specific medium which a current or potential future human or
environmental receptor may contact at an exposure point.

For soil within the Site, exposure points are identified based on the vertical and horizontal
distribution of Site Contaminants of Concern in conjunction with the soil categories determined
to be applicable (310 CMR 40.0924). Characterizing risk under a Method 1 risk characterization
involves comparing EPCs to applicable Method 1 standards.  A Condition of No Significant Risk
of harm to health, public welfare or the environment exists if no EPC is greater than the
applicable MCP Method 1 standard. Two separate exposure points are being evaluated at the
Site since two separate areas were affected.  As previously stated, the exposure points are
referred to as the “locomotive release area” and “retention pond #2”.

For the locomotive release area, the average detected concentration of analytes located at an
exposure depth ranging from 0.9 to 6 feet bgs within the Disposal Site boundary was used as
the EPC. No residual impacts are present at a depth greater than 6 feet bgs. The arithmetic
average of Site soil data represents a conservative estimate for the average concentration per
310 CMR 40.0926(3)(b) because the arithmetic average is less than or equal to the applicable
standard (Method 1 S-2/GW-3), 75 percent of the data points used are equal to or less than the
applicable standards and no data point used in the averaging is ten times greater than the
applicable standard. In order to provide a conservative estimate of the potential risks of harm to
the current and potential future human receptors that may be present at the Site, for each
Contaminant of Concern in soil, the EPC utilized for the estimation of potential risks was set
equal to the mean or average of that Contaminant of Concern detected in any of the soil
samples analyzed. In calculating the EPCs, when an analyte was not detected above the
laboratory reporting limit, one-half of the limit was used in the calculation. Only one sample,
SB-07 was located outside the disposal site boundary; therefore, sample SB-07 was not used in
calculating the EPCs.

For the retention pond #2 area, the maximum concentration for all analytes detected in the
29 samples were used as the EPC, as no analyte was detected above any of the Method 1 soil
standards.

Based on visual and olfactory observations made during the excavation activities, as well as
laboratory analytical data for soil samples collected from the Site, residual diesel fuel impacts to
soil are not present in either area at depths greater than six feet bgs. The applicable soil
category for soil located at depths of 0 to 3 feet is S-2 and the applicable soil category for soil
located at depths greater than 3 feet is S-3. The EPCs were also compared to the S-1 soil
category for unrestricted future use.

For the locomotive release area, the table showing the soil EPCs, using the average
concentration of each analyte, is provided as Table 5 and also shown on the table below:

6.7 METHOD 1 RISK CHARACTERIZATION RESULTS

The Method 1 Risk Characterization has evaluated current and foreseeable future Site activities
and uses, as well as current and potential future human and environmental receptors.  EPCs for
each Site Contaminant of Concern in soil have been developed in accordance with the MCP,
310 CMR 40.0926.  It is the opinion of Amec Foster Wheeler that the soil EPCs developed for
the Site are representative of actual subsurface conditions and need not be modified by other
exposure assumptions.  A comparison of each soil EPC to its respective, applicable MCP

Permanent Solution Statement With Conditions

Release Tracking Number 2-19355
November 2015

Page 37

Method 1 soil standards indicates that for the locomotive release area, with the exception of one
VPH fraction, C9-C10 Aromatics, all Site soil EPCs are below the MCP Method 1
S-1/GW-3, S-2/GW-3, and S-3/GW-3 soil standards. The EPC for C9-C10 Aromatics is above
the MCP Method 1 S-1/GW-3 standard but below the applicable Method 1 S-2/GW-3 and
S-3/GW-3 standards. With respect to the retention pond #2 area, all Site soil EPCs are below
the MCP Method 1 S-1/GW-3 and S-2/GW-3 soil standards.  Therefore, in accordance with the
MCP, 310 CMR 40.0973(7), a condition of No Significant Risk of harm to human health, public
welfare and the environment exists for current and unrestricted future use of the retention pond
#2 area.

In summary, a condition of No Significant Risk of harm to human health, public welfare and the
environment exists for current use of the Site and conditions apply for future site use since
residential Method 1 S-1 standards were not achieved for the one VPH fraction in one area of
the Site, referred to as the locomotive release area.  The entire locomotive release area is
located within an active railroad right-of-way and the foreseeable use in that area is not
expected to be residential. As per 310 CMR 40.1013(1)(c), an Activity and Use Limitation is not
required since the Site is located within a railroad right-of-way.

6.8 CHARACTERIZATION OF RISK OF HARM TO SAFETY

Conditions at the Site related to the release associated with RTN 2-19355 do not currently, and
will not in the foreseeable future, pose a threat of physical harm or bodily injury to people.
There are no rusted or corroded drums or containers, open pits, lagoons or other dangerous
structures at the Site. There is no threat of fire or explosion at the Site as a result of the release
of petroleum hydrocarbons detailed in this report. Furthermore, there are no uncontained
materials at the Site that exhibit the characteristics of reactivity, corrosively, or flammability
described in the MCP, 310 CMR 40.0347.  Based on the information presented herein, it is the
opinion of Amec Foster Wheeler that a condition of No Significant Risk of harm to safety exists
at the Site.

6.9 HOT SPOT EVALUATION

Consistent with the MCP (310 CMR 40.0924) and the Guidance for Disposal Site Risk
Characterization (MassDEP, 1995), discrete areas that meet the MCP definition of a Hot Spot
(310 CMR 40.0006) must be considered distinct exposure points.  A Hot Spot is identified based
on concentrations of OHM within a contaminated area and the spatial pattern of the
concentrations.  In all cases, a discrete area where the average concentration of an OHM is
greater than 100 times the average concentration in the immediate surrounding area shall be
considered a Hot Spot.  Also, a discrete area where levels of constituents are at least 10 times
greater than the average level of those constituents in surrounding area and exposure potential
to the discrete area is greater than that for surrounding soil shall be considered a Hot Spot.  If
these criteria are not met, then a Hot Spot does not exist.  However, regardless of these criteria,
concentrations equal to or below the applicable Method 1 standards cannot be considered
indicative of a Hot Spot.

Based on the size of the Site associated with RTN 2-19355, the Site’s physical characteristics and
the horizontal and vertical distribution of the soil samples located within the boundaries of the Site,
exposure potential is consistent throughout the entirety of the Site.  Therefore, only discrete areas
with concentrations greater than 100 times the surrounding area concentrations shall be
considered Hot Spots.

Of the samples that represent the soil data set, only one EPH fraction, C9-C18 Aliphatics, was
detected in two samples located in the locomotive release area, SS-06 and SS-09, at 4,220 and
3,080 mg/kg, respectively, slightly above the applicable Method 1 S-2/GW-3 standard of
3,000 mg/kg. This concentration is less than 100 times the concentration of the EPH fraction
detected in the surrounding samples; hence, these locations are not considered a Hot Spot. In the
retention pond #2 area, no analytes were detected in any of the samples above any of the Method
1 soil standards. Therefore, no Hot Spots are present in soil at the Site.

6.10 UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS

The MCP Method 1 Standards are based on the current understanding of toxicity at the time of
promulgation.  Dose-response values for non-carcinogenic health effects are usually based on
limited toxicological data.  For this reason, a margin of safety of at least an order of magnitude is
built into the estimates of non-carcinogenic toxicity values.  The MCP standards based on these
toxicity values may be at least an order of magnitude lower than actually necessary.

Human dose-response values (used to derive the MCP standards) are often extrapolated, or
conservatively estimated, using the results of animal studies.  Extrapolation from animals to
humans introduces a great deal of uncertainty in the risk assessment because in most instances
it is not known how differently a human may react to the chemical compared to the animal
species used to test the compound.  The procedures used to extrapolate from animals to
humans involve conservative assumptions and incorporate several uncertainty factors (explicit
factors for species extrapolation, and possible sensitive populations in the case of the reference
dose (RfD)) that are more likely to over-estimate than under-estimate no-effect dose in humans.
Again, the effect of this is that the MCP standards based on these toxicity values may be
substantially lower than actually necessary.

6.11 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

A Method 1 risk characterization was conducted to evaluate the need for additional remedial
actions by establishing whether a Condition of No Significant Risk of harm of health, safety,
public welfare and the environment exists at the Site.  The result of the risk characterization
indicated that a Condition of No Significant Risk of harm to health, public welfare, safety and the
environment was achieved at the Site.  Therefore, a Permanent Solution with Conditions has
been achieved at the Site.  This Permanent Solution does not require the implementation of an
Activity and Use Limitation per 310 CMR 40.1013(1)(c) of the MCP, as the Site is located within
a railroad right-of-way.

7.0 REPRESENTATIVENESS EVALUATION AND DATA USABILITY ASSESSMENT
(REDUA)

The following Data Usability Assessment (DUA) has been prepared to document that the data
relied upon are scientifically valid, defensible, and of a sufficient level of precision, accuracy,
and completeness to support this Permanent Solution Statement with Conditions and Method 1
risk characterization.  A Representativeness Evaluation has been included within this DUA to
document the adequacy of the spatial data sets used to support the findings of this Permanent
Solution Statement with Conditions and Method 1 risk characterization.

Select soil samples collected at the Site from November 2014 to May 2015 and used to support
this Permanent Solution Statement with Conditions and Method 1 risk characterization were
reviewed as part of this DUA. All of the samples were submitted to Alpha Analytical
Laboratories of Westborough, Massachusetts (Alpha) for laboratory analysis. The results of the
DUA and Representative Evaluation are discussed below.

Final implementation of the MassDEP Phase I Data Enhancement Program, as documented in
the MassDEP Compendium of Analytical Methods (CAM), occurred on August 1, 2003.  All
state-certified laboratories performing analytical methods listed in the CAM guidelines were
required to document in laboratory data packages whether the analytical methods performed
and reported met CAM guidelines for “Presumptive Certainty” of the data.

All CAM-compliant laboratory analytical reports document the results of quality assurance/
quality control (QA/QC) batch samples such as method blank, laboratory control spike (LCS),
laboratory control spike duplicate (LCSD), matrix spike (MS), and matrix spike duplicate (MSD)
samples.  In addition, the laboratory must meet all equipment calibration, internal standard, and
matrix spike quality control requirements to meet the CAM definition of ‘Presumptive Certainty,’
although CAM does not require this quality control information to be documented in the
laboratory report.  However, CAM does require that any quality control issues the laboratory has
with the data be included within each data package’s Case Narrative.  All data analyzed under
the CAM guidelines were reported by the laboratory as having met Presumptive Certainty
requirements.

7.1 SAMPLE ANALYTICAL DATA USABILITY

The following Data Usability Assessment (DUA) has been prepared to document that the data
relied upon are scientifically valid, defensible, and of a sufficient level of precision, accuracy,
and completeness to support this Permanent Solution Statement. All of the analytical data are
subject to the “presumptive certainty” requirements as defined in “Quality Assurance and Quality
Control Guidelines for the Acquisition and Reporting of Analytical Data” (BWSC-CAM-VIIA, rev.
1 dated July 1, 2010).  Amec Foster Wheeler utilized the data usability criteria as defined in
“MCP Representativeness Evaluations and Data Usability Assessments” (BWSC Policy
#WSC-07-350), as well as the individual analytical methods defined in MassDEP’s
Compendium of Analytical Methods (CAM) to assess data quality and data usability.

All CAM-compliant laboratory analytical reports document the results of quality assurance/
quality control (QA/QC) such as method blank, laboratory control spike (LCS), laboratory control
spike duplicate (LCSD), matrix spike (MS), matrix spike duplicate (MSD) samples, and
surrogates.  In addition, the laboratory must meet all equipment calibration and internal standard

quality control requirements to meet the CAM definition of ‘Presumptive Certainty,’ although
CAM does not require this quality control information to be documented in the laboratory report.
However, CAM does require that any quality control issues the laboratory has with the data be
included within each data package’s Case Narrative.  All data analyzed under the CAM
guidelines were reported by the laboratory as having met Presumptive Certainty requirements.

Soil and storm water (water samples collected from retention pond #3) data were provided to
Amec Foster Wheeler by Alpha during the sampling events.  The tables provided in
Appendix D list the QA/QC issues.  The analytical data usability review elements included, but
were not limited to laboratory control samples, surrogate recoveries, matrix spike/matrix spike
duplicates, blank results and case narratives. The field data usability review elements included,
but were not limited to sample collection, holding times, sample receipt, and sample
preservation. Qualifications that may affect the usability of the data are marked with a “J”. No
data was rejected.

Another important aspect of the Data Usability Assessment is to ensure that the necessary
sensitivity has been attained for site data and that the reporting limits achieved the applicable
standards.  Alpha has reported the lowest dilutions possible following standard protocols. All
samples have achieved the necessary sensitivity.

Soil and storm water laboratory analytical data are considered to meet the requirements for
defensibility, precision, accuracy and reporting of data of sufficient quality to support decision
making in this Permanent Solution Statement.

All soil samples included within this DUA were collected by Amec Foster Wheeler personnel.
The review elements included but were not limited to LCS/LCSDs, surrogate recoveries, method
blank results and case narratives. All of the data achieved Presumptive Certainty status, but the
following Quality Control performance standards and/or recommendations for methods were not
achieved:

7.2 SAMPLE FIELD DATA USABILITY

The field component of the Data Usability Assessment evaluates whether the sampling
procedure ensures that the samples collected and delivered to the laboratory are representative
of the sampling points.  The review elements included, but were not limited to appropriate
sample collection procedures, holding times, sample receipt, appropriate sample containers,
and sample preservation, if applicable.  As summarized in Section 3, Amec Foster Wheeler
collected soil samples at the Site for laboratory analysis. Soil samples were collected in

laboratory-supplied containers. All samples were stored in a refrigerated cooler or refrigerator
at temperatures ranging from 2° C to 6° C in order to aid in sample preservation, transferred to
the laboratory under chain-of-custody protocols, and analyzed within the appropriate holding
times. The data did not require any qualifications due to field data issues.

Soil data are considered to be usable under the MCP. The data are scientifically valid and
defensible, and of a sufficient level of precision, accuracy, and completeness to support this
Permanent Solution Statement.

7.3 REPRESENTATIVENESS EVALUATION

7.3.1 Conceptual Site Model

The Conceptual Site Model is discussed within Section 5 of this report.

7.3.2 Use of Field Screening Data

During the soil excavation activities that occurred at retention pond #2, as well as the soil
investigation that occurred in the locomotive release area, all soil samples that were collected
were field screened for headspace analysis with a PID equipped with a 10.6 electron volt lamp
calibrated to a benzene standard to evaluate the extents of the soil impacts.  In addition, each
soil sample was also examined for visual and olfactory evidence of contamination. The field
screening and visual/olfactory inspection data were used to complement the assessment of the
Site and aid in the selection of samples submitted for laboratory analysis. In the locomotive
release area where soil excavation activities did not occur, soil samples that that exhibited
headspace screening readings at or near 100 ppm were also submitted for laboratory analysis
of VPH with target VOCs.

In the retention pond area, the soil was field screened during excavation activities to assist in
evaluating the impacts remaining in soil and determine when sufficient petroleum impacted soil
had been removed. The soil exhibiting the highest headspace readings was located in the
locomotive release area at a depth less than two feet bgs.

Due to the heavier hydrocarbon fractions and compounds in diesel fuel, field screening data
were only moderately consistent with laboratory analytical data.  No field screening data were
used to determine EPCs or define nature and extent of OHM impacts at the Site.

7.3.3 Sampling Rationale

In the retention pond area, soil excavation activities began on the sides of the pond that were
impacted when the diesel fuel was initially discharged to the pond on November 7, 2014 and
came in contact with the sides prior to the impacted surface being removed with a vacuum
truck.  This area was exhibited visual and olfactory evidence of contamination.  The peastone
located at the culvert and the rip rap located on both sides of the gate valve were also impacted
by the diesel fuel release and later excavated for off-site disposal. Confirmatory samples were
collected along the northern, eastern and southern sidewalls of the pond at distances ranging
from every 10 to 20 feet at depths ranging from 4 to 13 inches bgs.  In the two areas located
immediately east and west of the gate valve, to confirm that the petroleum impacted soil was
removed, four confirmatory sidewall samples and one confirmatory bottom sample, were

Permanent Solution Statement With Conditions

November 2015

Page 42

collected from each area. In the culvert area, to confirm that the petroleum impacted soil was
removed, three confirmatory soil samples, including a bottom sample, were collected.

In the locomotive release area, samples were collected to evaluate the horizontal and vertical
extents of contamination and to confirm that groundwater was not impacted.  The analytical
results of the initial samples collected from test pits showed that additional delineation was
necessary. Therefore, a subsurface investigation was performed on both sides of the track
where the release initially occurred. Although an impermeable plastic geomembrane was
present at a depth of approximately nine inches bgs to the north of the track, several soil
samples were collected and submitted for laboratory analysis to determine the extent of impacts
remaining in the soil above the plastic geomembrane and below the ballast.  Samples collected
during the subsurface investigation to the south of the track evaluated the extent of impacts
remaining in the soil since no plastic geomembrane was present.

In summary, a total of 29 post-excavation samples were used to represent the extent of the soil
impacts remaining in the retention pond after excavation activities were completed. A total of 14
soil samples were collected in the locomotive release area to show that the extents of impacts
had been defined. All soil samples were submitted to Alpha for laboratory analysis for EPH
fractions with fuel oil range target PAHs. Two samples collected from the locomotive release
area were also submitted for VPH fractions with target VOCs. The results of the soil sample
laboratory analyses indicate that the lateral extents of petroleum hydrocarbon impacts to the
subsurface environment beneath the Site property have been adequately defined.

The sampling locations are deemed sufficient to delineate the Disposal Site Boundary, identify
background concentrations, calculate EPCs, identify Hot Spots and exposure pathways and
receptors, and demonstrate source elimination or control.

7.3.4 Spatial Distribution, Collection Methods and Handling of Samples

The 29 post-excavation confirmatory soil samples that were collected from the retention pond
#2 area were spatially distributed, as they were collected from the horizontal and vertical extents
at the Disposal Site Boundary to confirm that the diesel fuel impacted soil was removed. The
sidewall samples were collected at distances less than 20 feet apart and the samples collected
on both sides of the gate valve, as well as within the culvert, were collected from the bottoms
and sides of the excavations to ensure that the impacted soil had been excavated and removed.
The 14 soil samples collected via test pit excavation or soil boring advancement were collected
within the release area, as well as on the perimeters of the boundary to show that the vertical
and horizontal extents of impacts have been defined. All of the soil samples collected in both
areas of the Site were discrete grab samples and were collected to be representative of the Site
conditions based on field screening and visual and olfactory observations.

Each sample was placed in the prescribed sample collection container and was stored on ice
until it could be mechanically refrigerated.  During sample collection, samples were collected
utilizing MassDEP sampling protocols currently in effect.  All media-specific samples submitted
for laboratory analysis were derived from grab samples collected from the Site.

7.3.5 Temporal Distribution of Samples

Groundwater was not impacted from this release. Therefore, there is no temporal distribution of
samples.

7.3.6 Inconsistency and Uncertainty

No inconsistencies or uncertainties were identified in the soil sample sets used to support this
Permanent Solution Statement.  The contaminants identified in soil beneath the Site were
characteristic of the source of the diesel fuel release. This includes the site assessment data
and the field screening data and visual/ olfactory observations which are in general consistent
with the analytical data.

7.3.7 Completeness

No data gaps were identified in the sampling and analytical information used to support this
Permanent Solution Statement.  The information contained herein and the number and locations
of soil samples collected are adequate to satisfy the objectives of the Permanent Solution
Statement.

Critical samples representative of soil conditions beneath the Site were used to determine
representative EPCs to support the findings of this Permanent Solution Statement.  All critical
samples, those samples without which the Method 1 risk characterization could not be
completed, were determined by this evaluation to be usable without qualification.

7.3.8 Information Considered Unrepresentative

For the locomotive release area, sample SB-07 is considered unrepresentative of the Disposal
Site Boundary, as no analytes were detected in the sample above the laboratory reporting limits.
This sample was not used in calculating the EPCs for the risk assessment or in determining the
Disposal Site Boundary.

For the retention pond #2 area, all samples were considered representative and were used in
calculating the EPCs for the risk assessment and were used to evaluate the Disposal Site
Boundary. Based on the aforementioned Representativeness Evaluation, no data were
eliminated from the retention pond #2 area for use in this Permanent Solution Statement due to
being non-representative of post-remedial conditions.

7.4 REDUA SUMMARY

All of the laboratory analytical data described in the previous sections is suitable to support a
Permanent Solution decision.  None of the performance standards and/or recommendations for
the methods used for soil has impacted any use of the data.

9.0 FEASIBILITY EVALUATION

As required by 310 CMR 40.1020(3) of the MCP, the feasibility of reducing OHM in the
environment at a Site or a portion of a Site to levels that achieve or approach background must
be evaluated.  This is accomplished using the criteria outlined in 310 CMR 40.0860 in each
case where one or more remedial actions have been taken to achieve a Permanent Solution.
Amec Foster Wheeler has prepared this feasibility evaluation in accordance with MassDEP
guidance entitled “Conducting Feasibility Evaluations Under the MCP”, MassDEP Final Policy
#WSC-04-160, July 2004 (the “Policy”).

The completed remedial activities were designed to achieve a Permanent Solution at this Site
based on the following criteria of 310 CMR 40.0850(4):

 The selected remedial technologies were technically feasible.

 The costs of implementing the alternatives were justified by the benefits.

 Individuals with the expertise required to implement the alternatives were available.

 The selected alternative did not require the land disposal of oil or hazardous materials
for which there are no current facilities available to accept such materials.

 The alternative was implemented at the source to reduce and/or eliminate source area
contamination.

In accordance with the 310 CMR 40.1020(3) of the MCP and the Policy, Amec Foster Wheeler
has performed an evaluation of the feasibility of achieving or approaching background
concentrations in soil at the Site.

9.1 CONDITIONS OF CATEGORICAL FEASIBILITY

Conditions of categorical feasibility include Site conditions whereby a Condition of No Significant
Risk is achieved and the remaining impacts are limited to 20 cubic yards or less of impacted soil
where such soil is:

 Located less than three feet bgs;

 Not covered by pavement or a permanent structure;

 Not located within a sensitive environment (i.e. wetlands); and

 Not located in an area an area where soil removal would substantially interrupt public
service or threaten public safety.

At this Site, conditions of categorical feasibility do not apply for the reason that the remaining
impacted soil located adjacent to the railroad tracks is present in an area where additional soil
removal would substantially interrupt rail traffic. In both locations, the remaining impacts
constitute an volume likely greater than 20 cubic yards.

9.2 CONDITIONS OF CATEGORICAL INFEASIBILITY

Conditions of categorical infeasibility include the following conditions:



Immediate Response Action Completion Report and
Permanent Solution Statement With Conditions
CSX Intermodal Terminal
271 Franklin Street, Worcester, Massachusetts
Release Tracking Number 2-19355
November 2015

Page 46

 Excavation beneath a permanent structure;

 Remedial actions that would substantially interrupt public service or threaten public
safety;

 Remediation of degradable non-persistent contaminants; and

 Remediation of persistent contaminants located in S-2 and S-3 soils.

The Contaminants of Concern in soil at the Site are all petroleum related. According to the
Policy, each of these analytes is considered non-persistent and degradable.  Therefore, it can
be considered categorically infeasible to reduce the concentrations of those Contaminants of
Concern to levels that achieve background. In addition, as stated in the previous section, the
remaining impacted soil located adjacent to the railroad tracks is present in an area where
additional soil removal would substantially interrupt rail traffic.

9.3 CONDITIONS APPROACHING BACKGROUND IN NON-PERSISTENT COMPOUNDS

According to the Policy, “achieving or approaching background can be deemed infeasible for
non-persistent contaminants regardless of media classification, except for small quantities of
petroleum-contaminated soil.  The benefits of additional remedial actions to achieve or
approach background for degradable non-persistent contaminants would be considered
insufficient to justify the costs of those actions.”

Since the Contaminants of Concern at the Site are all non-persistent compounds, a
technological evaluation identifying additional remedial actions to achieve or approach
background and a benefit-cost evaluation are not required.

9.4 FEASIBILITY EVALUATION CONCLUSIONS

Based on information contained in the Policy, it is considered infeasible to achieve or approach
background because soil remaining at the Site has the following characteristics:

 The soil contains only non-persistent compounds;

 The soil located in both areas constitutes a volume likely greater than 20 cubic yards;
and

 Removal of the soil located adjacent to the railroad tracks would substantially interrupt
rail traffic.

Current Site conditions meet a Condition of No Significant Risk, as documented in this
Permanent Solution Statement, including a Method 1 risk characterization.

12.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Based upon the results of the Method 1 risk characterization, the requirements for a Permanent
Solution Statement with Conditions has been achieved.  The results of the surbsurface
investigations and remedial activities conducted at the Site are outlined below:

 The cause of the release at the Site which occurred on November 7, 2014 was due to a
faulty filter canister clamp located on the engine of a locomotive which caused a release
of approximately 2,300 gallons of diesel fuel onto the surrounding ballast.

 The majority of the release migrated via an impermeable plastic geomembrane which
was constructed on the north side of the tracks to an underground storm water collection
system that ultimately discharged into an onsite storm water retention pond.

 Two areas of the Site were affected and included the locomotive release area which is
the initial location of the release, as well as retention pond #2, a self-contained unlined
storm water retention pond, where the release ultimately discharged.  The retention
pond is typically dry except during and after rainfall events.  At the time of the release,
the retention pond was not dry and contained a significant amount of water due to a prior
rainfall event.

 Remedial actions consisted of the excavation and off-site disposal of 42.39 tons of
petroleum impacted soil, peastone, and rip rap from the retention pond. The soil was
transported to ESMI of Loudon, New Hampshire on two occasions for thermal desorption
under a Bill of Lading.

 Subsurface investigations were also conducted in the locomotive release area to
evaluate the horizontal and vertical extent of impacts on both sides of the tracks and to
determine the location of the impermeable geomembrane liner.

 Remedial actions also included the removal of 2,065 gallons of a diesel fuel/water
mixture from the retention pond and underground conduit located beside retention pond
using a vacuum truck. The diesel fuel/water was stored in two frac tanks and eventually
transported under a hazardous waste manifest on two occasions to Tradebe Treatment
& Recycling in Stoughton, Massachusetts for fuel blending.

 Soil samples collected by Amec Foster Wheeler in both the retention pond #2 and the
locomotive release areas were evaluated in accordance with the requirements of the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection’s Compendium of Analytical
Methods.  Presumptive Certainty exists for all of the analytical data.

 Currently there are no known oil and/or hazardous material sources remaining at the
Site.

 According to data obtained from the MassDEP Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup Phase 1
Site Assessment Map, the Site does not lie within a Current or Potential Drinking Water
Source Area, and according to the City of Worcester, the Site is not located within a
municipal aquifer protection district.  There are no private potable wells located within
the vicinity of the Site.

 The extents of soil impacts have been defined based on the collection of 29 confirmatory
post-excavation soil samples in the retention pond area, as well as 14 soil samples
collected from test pitting and soil boring advancement in the locomotive release area.
All of these samples were submitted for laboratory analysis of EPH fractions with diesel

range target PAHs.  Two samples collected in the locomotive release area were also
submitted for laboratory analysis of VPH fractions with target VOCs based on the
elevated headspace screening results.  The soil samples are considered representative
of current Site conditions.

 Groundwater was not affected by the release, as soil impacts did not extend past six feet
bgs and in the locomotive release area, the water table is located at a depth of
approximately 12 feet bgs.

 A Method 1 risk characterization was conducted to evaluate risk.  The Method 1
concluded that a Condition of No Significant Risk to human health, safety, public welfare,
and the environment exists for current use scenarios.

 Conditions apply for future site use since residential Method 1 S-1 standards were not
achieved for the one VPH fraction in the locomotive release area.  The entire locomotive
release area is located within an active railroad right-of-way and the foreseeable use in
that area is not expected to be residential. As per 310 CMR 40.1013(1)(c), an Activity
and Use Limitation is not required since the Site is located within a railroad right-of-way.

 A sheen is no longer being generated from residual concentrations of diesel fuel in the
locomotive release area that discharges to retention pond #2 based on observations of
the storm water that was most recently inspected after two major rainfall. Because the
absorbent booms located near the gate valve are effective in capturing debris from the
concrete culvert that discharges into the pond, they will temporarily remain in place until
January 2016 or until the first major snowfall occurs.

 A Permanent Solution Statement with Conditions has been achieved for the release at
the Site.

Shaded concentrations exceed the Method 1 S-1/GW-3 standards.

Bolded concentrations exceed the Method 1 S-2/GW-3 standards.

*Insufficient recovery - could not perform headspace screening.

**Due to frigid temperatures at the time of sampling, the soil sample was frozen upon collection and only partially defrosted when it was headspace screened; therefore, the headspace screening result may not be accurate.

Case Narrative

The samples were received in accordance with the Chain of Custody and no significant deviations were encountered during the preparation 

or analysis unless otherwise noted. Sample Receipt, Container Information, and the Chain of Custody are located at the back of the report.

Results contained within this report relate only to the samples submitted under this Alpha Lab Number and meet all of the requirements of 

NELAC, for all NELAC accredited parameters. The data presented in this report is organized by parameter (i.e. VOC, SVOC, etc.). Sample 

specific Quality Control data (i.e. Surrogate Spike Recovery) is reported at the end of the target analyte list for each individual sample, 

followed by the Laboratory Batch Quality Control at the end of each parameter. If a sample was re-analyzed or re-extracted due to a 

required quality control corrective action and if both sets of data are reported, the Laboratory ID of the re-analysis or re-extraction is 

designated with an "R" or "RE", respectively. When multiple Batch Quality Control elements are reported (e.g. more than one LCS), the 

associated samples for each element are noted in the grey shaded header line of each data table. Any Laboratory Batch, Sample Specific %

recovery or RPD value that is outside the listed Acceptance Criteria is bolded in the report. All specific QC information is also incorporated in 

the Data Usability format of our Data Merger tool where it can be reviewed along with any associated usability implications. Soil/sediments, 

solids and tissues are reported on a dry weight basis unless otherwise noted. Definitions of all data qualifiers and acronyms used in this 

report are provided in the Glossary located at the back of the report. 

In reference to questions H (CAM) or 4 (RCP) when "NO" is checked, the performance criteria for CAM and RCP methods allow for some 

quality control failures to occur and still be within method compliance.  In these instances the specific failure is not narrated but noted in the 

associated QC table. The information is also incorporated in the Data Usability format of our Data Merger tool where it can be reviewed 

along with any associated usability implications.

Please see the associated ADEx data file for a comparison of laboratory reporting limits that were achieved with the regulatory Numerical 

Standards requested on the Chain of Custody.

HOLD POLICY

For samples submitted on hold, Alpha's policy is to hold samples (with the exception of Air canisters) free of charge for 21 calendar days 

from the date the project is completed. After 21 calendar days, we will dispose of all samples submitted including those put on hold unless 

you have contacted your Client Service Representative and made arrangements for Alpha to continue to hold the samples. Air canisters will 

be disposed after 3 business days from the date the project is completed.

Please contact Client Services at 800-624-9220 with any questions.

Estimated Detection Limit: This value represents the level to which target analyte concentrations are reported as estimated 
values, when those target analyte concentrations are quantified below the reporting limit (RL). The EDL includes any 
adjustments from dilutions, concentrations or moisture content, where applicable. The use of EDLs is specific to the analysis of 
PAHs using Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME).
Environmental Protection Agency.

Laboratory Control Sample: A sample matrix, free from the analytes of interest, spiked with verified known amounts of analytes 
or a material containing known and verified amounts of analytes.
Laboratory Control Sample Duplicate: Refer to LCS.

Laboratory Fortified Blank: A sample matrix, free from the analytes of interest, spiked with verified known amounts of analytes 
or a material containing known and verified amounts of analytes.
Method Detection Limit: This value represents the level to which target analyte concentrations are reported as estimated values, 
when those target analyte concentrations are quantified below the reporting limit (RL). The MDL includes any adjustments from 
dilutions, concentrations or moisture content, where applicable.
Matrix Spike Sample: A sample prepared by adding a known mass of target analyte to a specified amount of matrix sample for 
which an independent estimate of target analyte concentration is available. 
Matrix Spike Sample Duplicate: Refer to MS.

Not Applicable.

Not Calculated:  Term is utilized when one or more of the results utilized in the calculation are non-detect at the parameter's 
reporting unit.
Not Ignitable. 

Non-Plastic: Term is utilized for the analysis of Atterberg Limits in soil.

Reporting Limit:  The value at which an instrument can accurately measure an analyte at a specific concentration. The RL 
includes any adjustments from dilutions, concentrations or moisture content, where applicable.
Relative Percent Difference:  The results from matrix and/or matrix spike duplicates are primarily designed to assess the precision
of analytical results in a given matrix and are expressed as relative percent difference (RPD).  Values which are less than five 
times the reporting limit for any individual parameter are evaluated by utilizing the absolute difference between the values; 
although the RPD value will be provided in the report.
Standard Reference Material: A reference sample of a known or certified value that is of the same or similar matrix as the 
associated field samples.

Total: With respect to Organic analyses, a 'Total' result is defined as the summation of results for individual isomers or Aroclors. If a 'Total' 
result is requested, the results of its individual components will also be reported. This is applicable to 'Total' results for methods 8260, 8081 
and 8082.
Analytical Method: Both the document from which the method originates and the analytical reference method. (Example: EPA 8260B is 
shown as 1,8260B.) The codes for the reference method documents are provided in the References section of the Addendum.

Spectra identified as "Aldol Condensation Product".

The analyte was detected above the reporting limit in the associated method blank. Flag only applies to associated field samples that 
have detectable concentrations of the analyte at less than ten times (10x) the concentration found in the blank. For MCP-related 
projects, flag only applies to associated field samples that have detectable concentrations of the analyte at less than ten times (10x) 
the concentration found in the blank. For DOD-related projects, flag only applies to associated field samples that have detectable 
concentrations of the analyte at less than ten times (10x) the concentration found in the blank AND the analyte was detected above 
one-half the reporting limit (or above the reporting limit for common lab contaminants) in the associated method blank. For NJ-
Air-related projects, flag only applies to associated field samples that have detectable concentrations of the analyte above the 
reporting limit. For NJ-related projects (excluding Air), flag only applies to associated field samples that have detectable 
concentrations of the analyte, which was detected above the reporting limit in the associated method blank or above five times the 
reporting limit for common lab contaminants (Phthalates, Acetone, Methylene Chloride, 2-Butanone). 
Co-elution: The target analyte co-elutes with a known lab standard (i.e. surrogate, internal standards, etc.) for co-extracted 
analyses.
Concentration of analyte was quantified from diluted analysis. Flag only applies to field samples that have detectable concentrations 
of the analyte.

1 The reference for this analyte should be considered modified since this analyte is absent from the target analyte list of the original
method.

Concentration of analyte exceeds the range of the calibration curve and/or linear range of the instrument.

The concentration may be biased high due to matrix interferences (i.e, co-elution) with non-target compound(s). The result should 
be considered estimated.
The analysis of pH was performed beyond the regulatory-required holding time of 15 minutes from the time of sample collection.

The lower value for the two columns has been reported due to obvious interference.

Reporting Limit (RL) exceeds the MCP CAM Reporting Limit for this analyte.

Presumptive evidence of compound. This represents an estimated concentration for Tentatively Identified Compounds (TICs), where 
the identification is based on a mass spectral library search.
The RPD between the results for the two columns exceeds the method-specified criteria.

The quality control sample exceeds the associated acceptance criteria. For DOD-related projects, LCS and/or Continuing Calibration
Standard exceedences are also qualified on all associated sample results.  Note: This flag is not applicable for matrix spike recoveries
when the sample concentration is greater than 4x the spike added or for batch duplicate RPD when the sample concentrations are less
than 5x the RL. (Metals only.)
Analytical results are from sample re-analysis.

Analytical results are from sample re-extraction.

Release Tracking Number 2-19355

Dear Mayor Petty:

This letter is being sent to you to fulfill the public involvement provisions of the Massachusetts Contingency
Plan (MCP) for the above-referenced Site. On November 7, 2014, approximately 2,300 gallons of diesel
fuel was released from a locomotive operated by CSX. The majority of the release migrated via a recently
constructed underground stormwater collection system that ultimately discharged to an onsite stormwater
retention pond. Approximately 40 tons of impacted soil, peastone and rip rap were excavated from the
sides of the retention pond and 2,065 gallons of a diesel fuel and water mixture were recovered from the
pond shortly after the release occurred. Low concentrations of diesel-related compounds in soil remaining
met the cleanup standards per the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP).  Therefore, the cleanup
performed achieved a condition of No Significant Risk and a Permanent Solution with Conditions due to
the remaining diesel fuel impacted soil remaining at the Site. As per CMR 40.1013(1)(c) of the MCP,
releases that are located within a railroad right-of-way are exempt from the requirements of an Activity and
Use Limitation.

The public involvement provisions [310 CMR 40.1403(3)(f)] requires that the Chief Municipal Officer and
the Board of Health in the community in which a disposal site is located be notified that a Permanent
Solution Statement with Conditions has been prepared for the above-named property and was submitted
electronically to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP). It is available for
review using the following link: http://public.dep.state.ma.us/SearchableSites2/Search.aspx
