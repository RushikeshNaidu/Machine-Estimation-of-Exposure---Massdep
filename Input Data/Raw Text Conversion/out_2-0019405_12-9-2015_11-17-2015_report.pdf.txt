RE: Immediate Response Action Completion Report 

Mr. Mike’s Mobil-branded Station 

 238 Main Street 

Townsend, Massachusetts 01469 

 RTN 2-19405 

 

 

To Whom It May Concern: 

 

On behalf of Global Partners LP, Alliance Energy Gasoline Division (Alliance), Environmental Compliance 

Services, Inc. (ECS) has prepared the following Immediate Response Action (IRA) Completion Report for 

the Mr. Mike’s Mobil-branded retail gasoline station located at 238 Main Street in Townsend, 

Massachusetts (herein referred to as the “Site”). 

 

On January 14, 2015 at 11:45 am, a two-hour reporting condition occurred at the Site when a gasoline 

leak was discovered at a fuel dispenser (Dispenser 1/2) during a routine underground storage tank (UST) 

system inspection.  Specifically, it was noted that gasoline was leaking from a two-inch diameter union 

fitting associated with Dispenser 1/2.  The previous UST system inspection was completed three weeks 

earlier on December 24, 2014 and no leaks from this dispenser were identified at that time.  A review of 

gasoline inventory records did not suggest a loss of product during the period between the UST system 

inspections on December 24, 2014 and January 14, 2015.  Furthermore, the records did not provide 

evidence regarding a specific date on which the release began.  As a result, an accurate estimate of the 

volume of gasoline leakage at fuel dispenser #1/2 could not be determined. 

 

Upon ECS obtaining knowledge of the release condition, the Massachusetts Department of 

Environmental Protection (MassDEP) was notified on January 14, 2015 and assigned Release Tracking 

Number (RTN) 2-19405.  MassDEP approved IRA activities at the Site including gasoline inventory 

reconciliation, removal of the leaking dispenser, field-screening of total organic vapors (TOVs) in nearby 

catchbasins and in the on-Site convenience store using a photoionization detector (PID), and removal of 

up to 50 cubic yards of contaminated soil if necessary.  A release notification form and the corresponding 

IRA Plan were submitted to the MassDEP on March 16 and 19, 2015, respectively.   

 

MassDEP Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup (BWSC) transmittal form BWSC105 is being submitted 

electronically to the MassDEP in conjunction with this IRA Completion Report.

2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION 

 

The Site is a 0.5-acre parcel of land improved with a 2,088 square foot convenience store, a shed, four 

USTs storing gasoline and diesel fuel, and a canopy covering two fuel dispensing islands.  The 

convenience store was built in 1983 and an addition was constructed in 2006.  The Site currently operates 

as a Mr. Mike’s Mobil-branded self-service gasoline station.  A Site location map and Site plan, 

illustrating pertinent Site features, have been included as Figures 1 and 2, respectively. 

 

The on-site USTs, consisting of one 2,500-gallon diesel, one 6,000-gallon gasoline, one 8,000-gallon 

gasoline and one 10,000-gallon gasoline tanks, are located northeast of the convenience store.  The fuel 

dispensing islands are located north of the convenience store.     

 

The Site is connected to the municipal water system.  An on-Site septic tank and leachfield are located to 

the east/southeast of the convenience store.  Stormwater catchbasins are located in Main Street to the 

north of the Site.  An open stormwater drainage basin which receives parking lot runoff is located on the 

south-central portion of the Site.   

 

The Site is located in a mixed residential and commercial area.  To the north of the Site is Main Street, 

across which are retail commercial properties, to the east and south of the Site are residential properties 

(presumably with basements), and to the west of the Site is Depot Street, across is a funeral home and 

paved parking lot.  The Site has relatively flat topography and the majority of the parcel is paved.  A 

grassy area is located on the south side of the convenience store.   

 

3.0 SITE HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF RELEASE CONDITION 

 

3.1 MassDEP RTN 2-641 

 

A tank tightness test was performed at the Site on January 13, 1989 and a leak was detected in a 

5,000-gallon gasoline UST formerly located northwest of the Site building near Depot Street.  

Two 5,000-gallon gasoline USTs were decommissioned and subsequently removed from Site at 

that time.  Groundwater recovery wells were installed in February 1989 and approximately 1,150 

gallons of impacted groundwater and light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) were recovered 

for disposal.

A Notice of Responsibility (NOR) was issued to Peterborough Oil Company (the former Site 

owner) on March 30, 1989 and RTN 2-641 was assigned by MassDEP.  A groundwater pump and 

treat and LNAPL recovery system was installed March 1989 and approximately 4,040 gallons of 

impacted groundwater and LNAPL were recovered by November 1989. 

 

A Phase I Initial Site Investigation and Tier II Classification were submitted to MassDEP on 

August 6, 1996.  A Phase II Comprehensive Site Assessment (CSA) and a Phase III Remedial 

Action Plan (RAP) were submitted to MassDEP on June 24, 1999.  A Phase IV Remedy 

Implementation Plan (RIP) detailing the installation of a soil vapor extraction (SVE) and air 

sparging (AS) remediation system was submitted to MassDEP on November 16, 1999.  The SVE 

system was activated on May 8, 2000, and the AS system was activated on June 29, 2000.  A 

Phase IV Final Inspection and Completion report was subsequently submitted to MassDEP on 

October 11, 2000.  A Remedy Operation Status (ROS) evaluation opinion was submitted to 

MassDEP on June 27, 2001, and six-month status reports documenting operation and 

maintenance (O&M) activities were submitted to MassDEP from June 2001 through September 

2003. 

 

Operation of the AS system was discontinued in July 2002, and the SVE system was later 

deactivated in March 7, 2003.  An evaluation of soil, soil gas, and groundwater quality was 

completed in July 2003.  The post-remedial evaluation included the advancement of six soil 

borings within previously impacted portions of the Site, and the collection and quantitative 

analysis of soil samples.  The results of the analyses indicated that concentrations of volatile 

petroleum hydrocarbons (VPH) were not detected above the laboratory reportable detection limits 

(RDLs).  Two soil gas points were installed in the immediate vicinity of the Site building and 

sampled to evaluate potential impacts to indoor air.  The soil gas sampling concluded that impacts 

to indoor air from the release were not likely.    

 

Two rounds of groundwater sampling were conducted in April and September 2003 after active 

remediation was discontinued at the Site. On the basis of historical and post-remedial 

investigations, it was concluded that petroleum impacts to unsaturated soils within the Disposal 

Site Area defined for RTN 2-641 had been reduced to background levels (below laboratory 

detection limits).  A Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) Method 2 Risk Characterization 

was completed.  Soil and groundwater quality data were evaluated according to Method 1 Risk 

Characterization Standards.  Soil gas and the potential for impacts to surface water associated 

with residual impacts to groundwater on the Site were evaluated using Method 2.  The Risk 

Characterization concluded that a condition of No Significant Risk of harm to human health, the 

public welfare and safety, and the environment was achieved for RTN 2-641.  A Class A-2 

Response Action Outcome (RAO) was therefore submitted in December 2003. 

 

3.2 MassDEP RTN 2-18629 

 

On July 7, 2012, a sudden surface release of approximately 13 gallons of gasoline occurred at the 

Site.  MassDEP was notified and assigned RTN 2-18629.  The source of the release was a faulty 

meter associated with fuel dispenser #8.  The meter discharged gasoline, spraying it against the 

interior of the dispenser skirt, some of which then drained to the exterior and base of the pump 

island and beneath the dispenser impacting peastone and soil.  The local fire department and Site 

personnel cleaned up the surface with speedi-dry.   



Project No. 91-218371.13/Document No. 45251 

MassDEP

Page 4 
 

 

During IRA activities in July 2012, impacted materials beneath the dispenser consisting primarily 

of peastone were removed to a depth of approximately 2 feet below grade (fbg).  Elevated TOV 

concentrations (287 to 1,291 parts per million [ppm]) were measured in soil headspace following 

the soil removal.  Quantitative analysis of post-excavation soil samples indicated the presence of 

VPH fractions at concentrations above the MassDEP Reportable Concentrations for S-1 soil 

(RCS-1).  It was determined that the limited excavation effort removed the majority of materials 

impacted by the gasoline release.  Further soil removal was prevented by the presence of the fuel 

dispenser and product piping.   

 

In July 2012, two groundwater monitoring wells (MW-101 and MW-102) were installed to the 

north and south of the leaking fuel dispenser.  Soil sampling indicated the presence of trace 

impacts to shallow subsurface soils, locally elevated concentrations of VPH in soil at the 

groundwater table, and substantially lower impacts to soil at greater depth in the saturated zone.  

Soils exhibiting the highest levels of residual contamination in borings MW-101 and MW102, 

present at the groundwater table, were dark gray and in marked contrast to similar materials 

present at shallower depths in those locations, suggesting the prolonged presence of reducing 

conditions indicative of petroleum contamination in those areas.  The concentrations of residual 

contamination detected in soil from the vicinity of the groundwater table in boring MW-101, 

located relatively upgradient with respect to groundwater flow from the release area, were 

substantially higher than those reported present in shallow soil in the release area and in soil from 

the groundwater table in boring MW-102, situated relatively downgradient with respect to 

groundwater flow from the source of the release.  These relationships suggested that the impacts 

to soil observed at the groundwater table in borings MW-101 and MW-102 were likely associated 

with the historical release and were not associated, or entirely associated, with the July 2012 

release. 

 

Groundwater sampling conducted in August and October 2012 indicated the presence of VPH in 

samples collected from monitoring wells MW-101 and MW-102, substantially lower 

concentrations of VPH in groundwater downgradient with respect to groundwater flow from the 

release area in the vicinity of well MW-1, and substantially higher concentrations of VPH in 

groundwater some distance upgradient with respect to groundwater flow from the release area in 

the vicinity of well E-3.  The results of analyses of groundwater from previously existing wells E-

3, OW-4, and MW-1 were consistent with the results of analysis of groundwater samples from 

these locations during the post-remedial assessment of groundwater quality performed in 2003 

prior to submittal of the RAO for RTN 2-641. The results of analysis of groundwater samples 

collected from wells MW-101 and MW-102 in August and October 2012 were consistent with 

historical groundwater quality data representing conditions in the general vicinity of the release in 

July 2012.  A Class A-2 RAO and Method 3 Risk Characterization were submitted for RTN 2-

18629 in March 2013.  

 

3.3 MassDEP RTN 2-19405 

 

On January 14, 2015, MassDEP was notified of a release at the Site when gasoline was observed 

leaking from a union fitting associated with Dispenser 1/2 during a routine UST system 

inspection.  MassDEP approved IRA activities at the Site including gasoline inventory 

reconciliation, removal/repair of the leaking dispenser, field-screening of TOVs at nearby 

catchbasins and in the on-Site convenience store, and removal of up to 50 cubic yards of

contaminated soil if necessary.  Further discussion of response actions associated with this release 

is provided in Section 4.    

 

3.4 MassDEP RTN 2-19427 

 

On February 13, 2015, during a Class B Monthly Operator Inspection for the on-Site UST system 

by ECS Eclipse of Agawam, MA, the inspector discovered what appeared to be a leak from a flex 

pipe within the diesel STP sump. MassDEP was notified of the release on the February 13, 2015 

and assigned RTN 2-19427.  The leaking flex line was promptly repaired, and a hydrostatic test 

was subsequently completed on the diesel STP sump, and it was determined to be tight. A 

Release Notification and Retraction was submitted to MassDEP on April 13, 2015. 

 

4.0 IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACTIONS 

 

Response actions conducted at the Site to date for RTN 2-19405 are summarized below. 

 

4.1 Post Spill Site Reconnaissance and Preliminary Assessment 

 

On January 14, 2015, immediately after discovery of the leak at Dispenser 1/2, the crash valves were 

tripped and this dispenser was deactivated.  A technician from WildCo Petroleum Equipment Sales 

and Service (WildCo), of Manchester, NH was dispatched to the Site on the same date.  Upon arrival 

and inspection of the dispenser, it was reported that a two-inch product line union fitting was leaking.  

The union fitting could not be loosened to make repairs; therefore, WildCo’s compliance division 

was requested to respond.   

 

A. Govoni Backhoe Service (Govoni) of Shrewsbury, MA subsequently removed Dispenser 1/2 on 

January 15, 2015 for the purpose of providing access for limited soil assessment activities beneath it.  

The dispenser was temporarily relocated to the rear of the convenience store and the electrical and 

product lines were capped.  Subsequent to ECS’ evaluation of soil conditions beneath the dispenser, 

further discussed below, the dispenser was repaired by Govoni on January 26, 2015.  The super 

unleaded gasoline product line was tested on January 28, 2015 by WildCo and passed.  Dispenser 1/2 

was subsequently put back into service at that time.     

 

An ECS field technician arrived at the Site at 3:20 pm on January 14, 2015 to conduct an Imminent 

Hazard (IH) evaluation and to pre-mark the Site for Dig-Safe notification.  Field-screening of TOVs 

using a PID was completed at two stormwater catchbasins located to the north of the Site in Main 

Street, on either side of the leaking dispenser, at the stormwater drainage basin on the south-central 

portion of the Site, at a catchbasin approximately 225 feet southeast of the convenience store, and 

indoor air within the convenience store (within the restrooms, sales floor, an electrical closet, coolers, 

office, and cash register attendant area).  TOV concentrations ranged from non-detect (0.0 ppm) to 

0.2 ppm.  Ice was noted to be present in the two catchbasins in Main Street to the north of the Site.   

 

On January 15, 2015, ECS returned to the Site to evaluate soil conditions beneath the leaking fuel 

dispenser, which had been removed that same morning by A. Govoni Backhoe Service.  Mr. Jason 

Ward from the MassDEP Central Regional Office was also present at the Site during ECS’ visit.  The 

leaking dispenser was temporarily located at the western side of the southernmost of the two fueling 

islands.  The fuel dispenser was determined not to have a pan present beneath it.  Materials present 

beneath the dispenser consisted of peastone.  TOVs in headspace at four locations beneath the 



Project No. 91-218371.13/Document No. 45251 

MassDEP

dispenser were field-screened and concentrations ranged from 122 to 800 ppm.  Four samples of 

peastone were collected at approximately 16 inches below grade and concentrations of TOVs 

measured in sample headspace ranged from 839 to 1,585 ppm.  ECS personnel used a hand auger to 

attempt to collect samples of native soil beneath the peastone.  The hand auger was advanced to 

approximately 32 to 48” at four locations beneath the dispenser between the product piping.  

Peastone was encountered at 48” at the easternmost sample, medium to coarse sand exhibiting TOV 

concentrations of 1,236 and 1,358 ppm was encountered at the two middle samples at 48”, and 

medium to coarse sand with a TOV concentration of 1,624 ppm was encountered at the last 

(westernmost) sample. 

 

During ECS’ Site visit on January 15, 2015, stormwater catchbasins located to the north of the Site 

on Main Street were screened again for TOVs using a PID, as well as indoor air within the 

convenience store, and floor drains in the restrooms.  TOV concentrations in the catchbasins were 

non-detect (0.0 ppm), and TOVs in the store were 0.2 ppm.  ECS did not observe any exposed piping 

containing the electrical conduits associated with the UST Veeder Root system or water and septic 

services inside of the building; therefore, field screening for TOVs in these conduits was not 

possible. 

 

As part of IRA activities approved by MassDEP, ECS obtained inventory records from December 

2014 and January 2015 for the gasoline USTs at the Site.  Gasoline inventory reconciliation data was 

reviewed for the time period in which the release is presumed to have occurred, between December 

24, 2014 and January 14, 2015.  Records indicate that during this period, the regular unleaded 

gasoline inventory had a positive variance (+243 gallons) while the super unleaded gasoline 

inventory had a negative variance (-38 gallons).  Based on this data, it appears that the inventory 

records alone cannot be used to determine the volume of gasoline released at dispenser #1/2.   

 

4.2 Installation of Groundwater Monitoring Wells, February and March 2015 

 

In an effort to assess the horizontal and vertical extent of impacts associated with the gasoline release 

at dispenser #1/2, ECS initiated a subsurface investigation program consisting of the installation of 

three on-Site groundwater monitoring wells (MW-103, MW-104, and MW-105), and the collection 

of select soil and groundwater samples from those locations for analysis of VPH and ethanol. 

 

Installation of groundwater monitoring wells began on February 20 and 25, 2015 and was completed 

by Drilex Environmental of West Boylston, MA with oversight provided by ECS personnel.  The 

boreholes for each monitoring well were pre-cleared using a vactor truck to depths of approximately 

8 to 10 fbg.  Soil borings were advanced on the east/southeast and south sides of the fuel dispensing 

island downgradient of the leaking dispenser (MW-103 and MW-104), and on the west and 

upgradient side of the leaking dispenser (MW-105). 

 

During pre-clearing activities, ECS personnel field-screened soil samples at one-foot intervals for 

TOVs using a PID.  TOV concentrations from the ground surface to 8 fbg at MW-103 ranged from 

1.5 to 5.9 ppm.  No staining or petroleum odors were observed.  A Geoprobe drill rig was used to 

advance this borehole to 18 fbg.  Soil samples collected at 8-10’, 10-15’, and 15-20’ were field-

screened for TOVs, which ranged from 0.3 to 6.7 ppm.  A petroleum odor and dark-brown to black-

stained soil was noted in the sample collected at 15-20’ (a depth at and below the groundwater table).  

Since low TOV concentrations were measured at this depth (6.7 ppm), it is therefore presumed that 

the odor and stained soils, observed at the groundwater table depth, are indicative of the previously 



Project No. 91-218371.13/Document No. 45251

described historical release associated with RTN 2-641.  This borehole was finished as a two-inch 

diameter groundwater monitoring well constructed with 10 feet of 0.010-inch slot polyvinyl 

chloride (PVC) well screen set at 8-18’, and attached with flush-threaded joints to 8 feet of solid 

PVC riser.  The annular space around the well screen was backfilled with sand.  A one-foot thick 

bentonite seal was installed above the sand pack to prevent surface water infiltration into the well.  

The annulus above the bentonite seal was backfilled with native material.  The well was finished 

with a traffic-rated water-tight road box cemented in place flush with the ground surface.  Upon 

completion, ECS developed MW-103 by purging groundwater using a disposable polyethylene 

bailer. 

 

On February 20, 2015, pre-clearing of MW-104 was initiated; however, concrete obstructions 

were encountered at approximately 1.5 fbg during two separate attempts, as well as a significant 

layer of frost, which slowed progress.  Drilex Environmental and ECS personnel returned to the 

Site on February 25, 2015, at which time monitoring well MW-104 was relocated further to the 

west due to the subsurface obstructions.  The location of MW-104 was installed in close 

proximity to a former on-Site monitoring well OW-5 (decommissioned).  Pre-clearing of MW-

104 occurred to 10 fbg.  Beginning at 1 fbg, soil samples were field-screened for TOVs at one-

foot intervals and concentrations ranged from 6.0 to 397.1 ppm, with the highest concentration of 

TOVs measured between 3 and 7 fbg.  The boring was further advanced to the depth of refusal 

(16.5 fbg) using a Geoprobe.  TOV concentrations ranged from 6.6 to 66 ppm in the 10-15’ 

sample and were measured as 30 ppm in the 15-16.5 fbg sample.  No petroleum odors or staining 

was observed in any of the soil samples from this boring.  Although elevated TOV concentrations 

were detected in the soil samples collected from within boring MW-104 at the 3-7 fbg, the 

apparent absence of obvious petroleum odors reported in the field documentation suggests that 

they may have been anomalous, and were potentially attributable to extreme cold weather 

conditions at the time of field screening.   

 

Due to borehole collapse and the limitations of the Geoprobe drill rig operated by Drilex 

Environmental, a monitoring well could not be installed in the borehole for MW-104 on February 

25, 2015.  As a result, pre-clearing of the borehole for MW-105 to 9 fbg was conducted on that 

date.  Soil samples were field-screened for TOVs at one-foot intervals and ranged from 4.5 to 

14.0 ppm.  No petroleum odors or staining was observed.  Drilling continued to 20 fbg with the 

Geoprobe at this location.  TOVs measured at the 10-15’ and 15-20’ fbg intervals ranged from 

25.7 to 76.4 ppm, respectively.  Due to time limitations, a monitoring well could not be installed 

by Drilex Environmental in the borehole for MW-105 on February 25, 2015. 

 

On March 16, 2015, ECS provided oversight during the installation of monitoring wells in the 

boreholes for MW-104 and MW-105.  This work was performed by Crawford Drilling Services, 

LLC of Westminster, Massachusetts using a Geoprobe drill rig.  Crawford Drilling Services 

drilled into the borehole locations previously advanced by Drilex Environmental.  An auger 

attachment was used on the Geoprobe to prevent borehole collapse.  Since soils were previously 

field-screened for TOVs and characterized during the drilling of these boreholes in February 

2015, these activities were not repeated on March 16, 2015.  Excess soil cuttings from MW-104 

and MW-105 were field-screened for TOVs.  Soil cuttings from MW-104 were measured at 9.6 

and 10.2 ppm, and soil cuttings from MW-105 were measured at 255 ppm.  As a result, these soil 

cuttings were containerized within two 55-gallon drums which were temporarily stored at the Site 

until they were later removed by TMC Environmental Services on April 9, 2015, and were 

transported to Northland Environmental, LLC in Providence, RI under a bill of lading.

A two-inch diameter groundwater monitoring well constructed with 10 feet of 0.010-inch slot PVC 

well screen set at 6.5 to 16.5’ attached with flush-threaded joints to 6.5 feet of solid PVC riser 

was installed at MW-104.  A two-inch diameter groundwater monitoring well constructed with 10 

feet of 0.010-inch slot PVC well screen set at 8 to 18’ attached with flush-threaded joints to 8 feet 

of solid PVC riser was installed at MW-105.  The annular space around the well screens was 

backfilled with sand.  A one-foot thick bentonite seal was installed above the sand pack to 

prevent surface water infiltration into the wells.  The annulus above the bentonite seals was 

backfilled with native material.  Both wells were finished with traffic-rated water-tight road boxes 

cemented in place and flush with the ground surface.  Upon completion, ECS developed MW-104 

and MW-105 by purging groundwater using a disposable polyethylene bailer. 

 

Soil samples collected at the groundwater table depth at each boring (10-15 fbg), as well as a soil 

sample collected at 6-7’ at MW-104, which exhibited the highest TOV concentration (397.1 

ppm), were selected for laboratory analysis of VPH and ethanol via USEPA Method 8260C.  

These samples were submitted under chain of custody (COC) to Con-Test Analytical of East 

Longmeadow, MA on February 27, 2015.  The samples were submitted with a trip blank for 

QA/QC purposes.   

 

According to the laboratory analytical report, VPH carbon fractions and target analytes were not 

detected at concentrations above the laboratory reportable detection limits (RDLs), with the 

exception of toluene detected at 0.086 milligrams per kilogram (mg/Kg) in the MW-104/10-15’ 

sample and at 0.067 mg/Kg in the MW-105/10-15’ sample.  These concentrations are well below 

the applicable RCS-1 standard of 30 mg/Kg, and the applicable MCP Method 1 S-1/GW-2 and S-

1/GW-3 standards of 500 mg/Kg.  Ethanol was not reported at concentrations above the 

laboratory RDLs in any of the samples.   

 

4.3 Groundwater Sampling, March 2015  

 

On March 20, 2015, ECS personnel returned to the Site to collected groundwater samples from 

monitoring wells MW-103, MW-104, and MW-105.  ECS completed a wellhead elevation survey at 

the same time.  The elevation survey determined that groundwater flows in an easterly direction 

across the site.  Note that historical groundwater flow contours, calculated during previous 

assessment activities, generally indicate a similar groundwater flow direction (southeast); 

however, previous contours (prepared by others) were developed using the former monitoring 

well network.   

 

Groundwater samples were collected using low flow sampling techniques and a peristaltic pump.  

Each monitoring well was gauged for depth to groundwater using an electronic water level meter.  

Temperature, pH, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and oxidation reduction potential 

(ORP) in groundwater at each well were monitored at three to five-minute intervals during 

purging and stabilization was achieved prior to sample collection.  Turbidity was measured at the 

time of sample collection.  No odors, oily sheens, or LNAPL were observed at any of the 

monitoring wells.  Depth to groundwater on March 20, 2015 ranged from 12.31 fbg at MW-105 

to 13.25 fbg at MW-103.

Groundwater samples from all three monitoring wells were submitted for laboratory analysis of 

VPH and ethanol.  The samples were stored on ice until received by Con-Test Analytical under 

COC on March 20, 2015.  The samples were submitted with a trip blank for QA/QC purposes.   

 

According to the laboratory analytical report, VPH C5-C8 aliphatic fractions were detected in all 

three groundwater samples at concentrations ranging from 110 ug/L (MW-104) to 1,300 ug/L 

(MW-103), all of which are below the applicable RCGW-2 and Method 1 GW-2/GW-3 

standards.  Concentrations of VPH C9-C10 aromatic fractions were detected in the groundwater 

samples from MW-103 and MW-105 (1,300 and 440 ug/L) at concentrations below applicable 

RCGW-2 and Method 1 GW-2/GW-3 standards.  VPH target analytes benzene, toluene, 

ethylbenzene, xylenes, methyl tert-butyl ether (MtBE) and/or naphthalene were detected in all 

three groundwater samples at concentrations below their respective RCGW-2 and Method 1 GW-

2/GW-3 standards.  Ethanol was not detected above the laboratory RDL or the RCGW-2 standard 

in any of the groundwater samples.  

 

Tables 1, 2, and 3 provided a summary of groundwater gauging data, field monitoring data and 

laboratory analytical results for March 20, 2015.  The soil borings logs, groundwater monitoring 

logs and groundwater analytical report for the March 2015 drilling and sampling events were 

provided in an IRA Status Report submitted to MassDEP on May 19, 2015. 

 

4.4 Groundwater Sampling, June 2015  

 

On June 11, 2015, ECS collected groundwater samples from monitoring wells MW-103, MW-104, 

and MW-105.  Groundwater sampling logs are provided as Attachment I.   

 

Groundwater samples were collected using low flow sampling techniques and a peristaltic pump.  

Each monitoring well was gauged for depth to groundwater using an electronic water level meter.  

Temperature, pH, specific conductivity, DO, and ORP in groundwater at each well were 

monitored at three to five-minute intervals during purging and achieved stabilization prior to 

sample collection.  Turbidity was measured at the time of sample collection.  A slight odor was 

noted in the samples from MW-103 and MW-104.  No oily sheens or LNAPL were observed at 

any of the monitoring wells.  Depth to groundwater on June 11, 2015 ranged from 12.02 fbg at 

MW-105 to 12.93 fbg at MW-103.   

 

Groundwater samples from all three monitoring wells were submitted for laboratory analysis of 

VPH.  The samples were stored on ice until received by Con-Test Analytical under COC on June 

11, 2015.  The samples were submitted with a trip blank for QA/QC purposes.   

 

According to the laboratory analytical report, VPH C5-C8 aliphatic fractions and/or C9-C10 

aromatic fractions were detected at concentrations above the laboratory RDLs in the samples 

collected from MW-103, MW-104, and MW-105.  The concentration of C5-C8 aliphatics in the 

sample from MW-103 (7,000 ug/L) exceeded the Method 1 GW-2 standard (3,000 ug/L, but not 

the GW-3 standard (50,000 ug/L).  In addition, one or more VPH target analytes were detected in 

the samples from MW-103, MW-104, and MW-105 above the laboratory RDLs, but below 

Method 1 GW-2/GW-3 standards.   

 

The groundwater analytical reports are provided as Attachment II.  Groundwater analytical 

results, field measurements, and gauging data are summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3.

4.5 Installation of Groundwater Monitoring Wells, September 2015 

 

On September 10, 2015, two additional monitoring wells (MW-106 and MW-107) were installed 

within the eastern portion of the site downgradient of the gasoline USTs and dispensers, to further 

delineate groundwater impacts.  The well locations are depicted on Figure 2.    

 

Installation of groundwater monitoring wells was performed by Crawford Drilling Services with 

oversight provided by ECS personnel.  The boreholes for each monitoring well were pre-cleared 

using a vactor truck to depths of approximately 7 to 8 fbg.  Following pre-clearing, a Geoprobe drill 

rig was used to advance each borehole.       

 

During pre-clearing activities, ECS personnel field-screened soil samples for TOVs using a PID at 

approximately 2.5 to 5-foot intervals from the ground surface to the maximum depth of exploration.  

MW-106 was terminated at approximately 17 fbg due to rock refusal, and MW-107 was terminated 

at approximately 20 fbg.  Concentrations of TOVs were not reported above the instrument detection 

limit (0.1 ppm) for all soil samples collected, with the exception of the 15-17.5’ fbg sample collected 

during advancement of MW-107 (1.2 ppm).   No staining or petroleum odors were reported during 

this subsurface investigation event.   

 

Both boreholes were finished as two-inch diameter groundwater monitoring wells set at 17 fbg 

(MW-106) and 19 fbg (MW-107).  The wells were constructed with 10 feet of 0.010-inch slot PVC 

well screen set at the depth of termination, and attached with flush-threaded joints to 7 and 9 feet 

of solid PVC riser.  The annular space around the well screen was backfilled with sand.  A one-

foot thick bentonite seal was installed above the sand pack to prevent surface water infiltration 

into the well.  The annulus above the bentonite seal was backfilled with native material.  The 

wells were finished with traffic-rated water-tight road boxes, which were cemented in place flush 

with the ground surface.  Upon completion, ECS developed each well by manually purging 

groundwater using a disposable polyethylene bailer. 

 

ECS personnel completed a wellhead elevation survey of the existing and newly installed 

groundwater monitoring wells on October 6, 2015.  Soil borings logs for MW-106 and MW-107 

are provided as Attachment III.  Based on the elevation survey and gauging results, groundwater 

flow direction at the site was determined to be southeast. 

 

Soil samples collected at the groundwater table depth at each boring (15-17.5 fbg) were selected 

for laboratory analysis of VPH and ethanol via USEPA Method 8260C.  These samples were 

submitted under COC to Con-Test Analytical of East Longmeadow, MA on September 10, 2015.  

The samples were submitted with a trip blank for QA/QC purposes.   

 

According to the laboratory analytical report, VPH carbon fractions, VPH target analytes and 

ethanol were not detected at concentrations above the laboratory RDLs.  The laboratory RDLs 

were below the applicable MCP Method 1 S-1/GW-2 and S-1/GW-3 standards.  The soil 

laboratory analytical report is provided as Attachment IV.  Soil analytical results are summarized 

in Table 4.

4.6 Installation of Soil Gas Sampling Points, September 2015 

 

On September 15, 2015, ECS installed two soil gas sampling points (SG-1 and SG-2) through the 

ground floor concrete slab in the northern portion of the on-site convenience store.  The soil gas 

points are depicted on Figure 2.    

 

Each soil gas point consisted of a brass Vapor Pin
TM

 installed in a 5/8-inch diameter hole drilled into 

the floor to a depth approximately one inch beneath the slab.  The top of the Vapor Pins have a barb 

fitting to attach flexible polyethylene tubing to allow for screening of TOVs and collection of soil gas 

samples.  Upon completion, each sampling point was fitted with a flush-mount cap. 

 

Immediately following installation, TOVs were measured at each point by connecting a PID to the 

sampling tube.  TOVs at SG-1 were 0.6 ppm and TOVs at SG-2 were 0.7 ppm.  Additional TOV 

concentrations measured at each point five minutes following the initial readings and were recorded 

as 0.4 ppm at SG-1 and 0.2 ppm at SG-2. 

 

4.7 Groundwater Sampling, September 2015 

 

On September 25, 2015, ECS collected groundwater samples from monitoring wells MW-103, MW-

104, MW-105, MW-106, and MW-107.  Groundwater sampling logs are provided as Attachment 

V.   

 

Groundwater samples were collected using low flow sampling techniques and a peristaltic pump.  

Each monitoring well was gauged for depth to groundwater using an electronic water level meter.  

Temperature, pH, specific conductivity, DO, and ORP in groundwater at each well were 

monitored at three to five-minute intervals during purging and stabilization was achieved prior to 

sample collection.  Turbidity was measured at the time of sample collection.  An odor was noted 

in the sample from MW-103.  No oily sheens or LNAPL were observed at any of the monitoring 

wells.  Depth to groundwater on September 25, 2015 ranged from 13.29 fbg at MW-105 to 14.50 

fbg at MW-107.   

 

Groundwater samples from all three monitoring wells were submitted for laboratory analysis of 

VPH.  The samples were stored on ice until received by Con-Test Analytical under COC on 

September 25, 2015.  The samples were submitted with a trip blank for QA/QC purposes.   

 

According to the laboratory analytical report, no VPH carbon fractions or target analytes were 

detected at concentrations exceeding the laboratory RDLs in the samples collected from MW-106 

and MW-107.  VPH C5-C8 aliphatic fractions and/or C9-C10 aromatic fractions were detected at 

concentrations above the laboratory RDLs in the samples from MW-103, MW-104, and MW-

105.  The concentration of C5-C8 aliphatic fractions in the sample collected from MW-103 (4,100 

ug/L) exceeded the Method 1 GW-2 standard but not the GW-3 standard.  One or more VPH 

target analytes were detected in the samples collected from MW-103 and MW-104 above the 

laboratory RDLs, but below Method 1 GW-1, GW-2, and GW-3 standards. 

 

The groundwater analytical report is provided as Attachment VI.  Groundwater analytical results, 

field measurements and gauging data are provided in Tables 1, 2, and 3.

4.8 Soil Gas Sampling, September 2015 
 

In conjunction with groundwater sampling on September 25, 2015, soil gas samples were 

collected from SG-1 and SG-2.  Initial TOV concentrations measured at each location with a PID 

and recorded after three minutes were documented below the instrument detection limit of 0.1 

ppm.   

 

Dedicated polyethylene tubing was connected to a sampling port on each vapor pin and soil gas 

samples were collected using 6-liter evacuated Summa canisters equipped with one-hour 

regulators provided by Con-Test Analytical.  Soil gas was collected for approximately 54 minutes 

at SG-1 and 57 minutes at SG-2.     

 

The Summa canisters were delivered to Con-Test Analytical on September 25, 2015 and analyzed 

for air phase hydrocarbons (APH).     

 

The laboratory analytical results were compared to the MassDEP residential and 

commercial/industrial values for sub-slab soil gas
1
.  According to the laboratory data, 

concentrations of all hydrocarbon fractions and target analytes were reported below laboratory 

RDLs, except for C5-C8 aliphatic fractions, toluene, and xylenes at SG-1, and C5-C8 aliphatic 

fractions and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) at SG-2.  All of the detected 

concentrations were below both the residential and commercial/industrial values.   

 

The soil gas analytical results are presented in Table 5. The laboratory analytical report is 

provided as Attachment VII. 

 

5.0 DATA USABILITY 

 

Soil and groundwater samples collected in June and September 2015 were analyzed for VPH according to 

the MassDEP methods and the MassDEP CAM finalized on August 1, 2003 and revised July 1, 2010.  This 

data has presumptive certainty for precision and accuracy.  A review of precision, accuracy, 

representativeness, completeness, comparability, and sensitivity (PARCCS) is provided below.   

 

Accuracy for VPH analyses was determined by the laboratory use of surrogate recoveries, which were all 

within the control limits of 70% to 130%.  In addition to the above, data representativeness, precision, and 

quality are evaluated by utilizing laboratory control samples (LCS), matrix duplicate samples, and method 

blank samples.   

 

Any deviation or anomalies regarding internal laboratory quality assurance and quality control procedures 

are documented in the laboratory case narrative section of the laboratory analytical reports.  Data Usability 

worksheets are provided with the laboratory analytical reports.  The non-conformance issues noted by the 

laboratory are not expected to adversely impact the usability of these data.  The non-conformance issues are 

documented in the laboratory case narrative section of the laboratory analytical reports.  No data were 

excluded or considered unusable based upon these non-conformances. 

 

To assure sample comparability, all sampling methods were completed in accordance with MassDEP and/or 

USEPA groundwater sampling procedures in accordance with ECS sampling Standard Operating

Procedures. Sampling containers, preservation methods, and holding times met method specific 

requirements.  All soil and groundwater samples were submitted to the laboratory on ice.  The temperature 

of the soil samples collected on September 10, 2015 and received by the laboratory on the same date was 

2.9°C.  The temperature of the groundwater samples collected on June 11, 2015 and received by the 

laboratory on the same date was 3.1°C.  The temperature of the groundwater samples collected on 

September 25, 2015 and received by the laboratory on the same date was 3.1°C.  All three sets of samples 

were received by the laboratory at temperatures within the USEPA recommended temperature of 4°C ± 2°C. 

 

To establish a degree of comparability for soil and groundwater sampling so that all data can be compared 

with historical and future data, ECS used standard methods of sampling collection.  All sampling and testing 

procedures are well documented so that they can be reproduced.  

  

The sensitivity of the data was reviewed by comparing laboratory method detection limits (MDLs) to 

applicable standards.  Laboratory MDLs were documented below the applicable Method 1 Standards in all 

samples. 

 

It is the opinion of ECS that the sampling locations and quantity of samples collected are sufficient to 

further characterize the Disposal Site, monitor the stability of the dissolved phase plume, calculate exposure 

point concentrations, evaluate potential exposure pathways, and demonstrate secondary source elimination 

and control. 

  

Any deviation or anomalies regarding internal laboratory quality assurance and quality control procedures 

are documented in the laboratory case narrative section of the attached laboratory analytical reports. 

   

Based upon this information, ECS is of the opinion that the laboratory analytical data for the soil and 

groundwater samples collected during the time period covered by this IRA Completion Report is of suitable 

quality to support the conclusions of this and future reports. 

 

6.0 SENSITIVE RECEPTOR EVALUATION 

 

The Squannacook River is the closest surface water body to the Site and is located approximately 1,200 

feet west and 1,300 feet south.  Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) and National Heritage 

and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) Estimated Habitats of Rare Wildlife are located along the 

Squannacook River.   

 

According to the MassDEP Priority Resource Map viewed online at 

http://maps.massgis.state.ma.us/images/dep/omv/mcpviewer.htm, the Site is not located within a Zone II 

of a public water supply, an Interim Wellhead Protection Area (IWPA) or a Potentially Productive 

Aquifer (PPA).  A mapped Zone II is located approximately 2,700 feet northeast of the Site.  A Medium 

Yield PPA is located approximately 1,200 feet southwest of the Site.  There are no known private water 

supplies within 500 feet of the Site.  The MassDEP Phase I Site Assessment Map is provided as Figure 3.   

 

The Site is not located within a current or potential drinking water source area; therefore, groundwater 

category GW-1 does not apply to the Site.   The average annual depth to groundwater at the Site is less 

than 15 fbg, therefore, category GW-2 applies to groundwater located within 30 feet horizontally of the 

Site building and occupied off-Site structures.  All groundwater has the potential to discharge to surface 

water; therefore, GW-3 also applies to groundwater beneath the Site.

Historical subsurface investigations and current groundwater elevations surveys indicate that groundwater 

at the site flows toward the southeast.  All on and off-Site groundwater monitoring wells installed for 

prior RTNs have been decommissioned.     

 

The MCP Method 1 Risk Characterization soil categories applicable at the Site are S-2 in landscaped 

areas where adult’s frequency and intensity of use are considered to be low and high, respectively, and 

children’s frequency and intensity of use are considered to both be low.  Remaining Site soils are 

categorized as category S-3 due their inaccessibility beneath either pavement, concrete, the existing Site 

building, or at depths greater than 15 fbg.  It should be noted that in consideration of future Site uses, soils 

located less than 15 fbg are potentially category S-1 soils. 

 

Based on the investigation activities conducted to date, conditions at the Site do not present an Imminent 

Hazard (IH) per 310 CMR 40.0006 and 40.0951-0955.  Site contaminants of concern (COCs) are not 

known to produce severe or acute effects for short-duration exposures at the concentrations detected at the 

Disposal Site.  On this basis, it is concluded that an IH with respect to human health does not exist at the 

Disposal Site. 

 

There is no evidence of stressed biota attributable to the release, or of a release to the environment which 

has or is likely to produce immediate or acute adverse effects on freshwater fish populations.  It is 

therefore concluded that an IH with respect to the environment does not exist at the Site.   

 

As stated in 310 CMR 40.0006, conditions of substantial release migration (SRM) include the following: 

 

 Releases that have resulted in the discharge of separate-phase oil and/or hazardous material to 
surface waters, subsurface structures, or underground utilities or conduits; 

 Releases to the ground surface or to the vadose zone that, if not promptly removed or contained, 
are likely to significantly impact the underlying groundwater, or significantly exacerbate an 

existing condition of groundwater pollution; 

 Releases to the groundwater that have migrated or are expected to migrate more than 200 feet per 
year; 

 Releases to the groundwater that have been, or are within one year likely to be, detected in a 
public or private water supply well; 

 Releases to the groundwater that have been, or are within one year likely to be, detected in a 
surface water body, wetland, or public water supply reservoir: or 

 Releases to the groundwater or to the vadose zone that have resulted or have the potential to 
result in the discharge of vapors into a school, daycare or childcare center, or occupied residential 

dwelling. 

  

The release for RTN 2-19405 has not resulted in the known discharge of NAPLs to surface waters or 

underground utilities or conduits.  VPH C5-C8 aliphatic hydrocarbons detected in groundwater samples 

collected from MW-103 (downgradient of the fuel dispensers) during the June and September 2015 

sampling events exceeded Method 1 GW-2 standard.  Groundwater samples collected at monitoring wells 

MW-106 and MW-107 in September 2015, located on-Site and downgradient of MW-103, did not 

contain VPH fractions or target analytes at concentrations above the laboratory RDLs or applicable 

Method 1 GW-1/GW-2/GW-3 standards.  Based upon existing release information and assessment data, 

the release is not likely to be detected in a public or private water supply well, surface water body, 

wetland, or public water supply reservoir.  Prior investigations at the Site have estimated an average 

hydraulic conductivity of 0.445 feet per day, effective soil porosity of 30%, and a hydraulic gradient of

0.02 ft/ft across the Site (June 1999 Phase II CSA).  The estimated groundwater seepage velocity beneath 

the Site is calculated to be range from 1.63 to 20.08 feet per year.  Based upon this information, it is the 

opinion of ECS that a SRM condition does not exist at the Site.     

 

Critical Exposure Pathways (CEPs) are those routes by which release materials are, or are likely to be, 

transported to human receptors via vapor-phase emissions in the living or working space of a pre-school, 

daycare, school, or occupied residential dwelling; or, ingestion, dermal absorption or inhalation of 

measurable concentrations of contaminants from drinking water supply wells located at and servicing a 

pre-school, daycare, school, or occupied residential dwelling.  The latter is not likely to occur as there are 

no drinking water supply wells located in the vicinity of the Site.  Additionally, based on field-screening 

of TOVs in nearby catchbasins following the release, field screening of TOVs in indoor air in the 

convenience store, soil gas sampling conducted beneath the on-site convenience store in September 2015, 

and relative locations of the on-Site and nearby downgradient structures, it is the opinion of ECS that no 

CEPs exist with respect to the discharge of vapor-phase contamination into indoor air at the Site or 

downgradient receptors in the vicinity of the Site. 

 

7.0 CONCLUSIONS  
 

It is the opinion of ECS that response actions conducted for the release which triggered this IRA 

condition have been sufficient to close the IRA pursuant to 310 CMR 40.0427. 

 

Based on information gathered during IRA activities, including field screening data, analytical results, 

observations of site conditions and nearby receptors, no conditions of SRM, Immediate or Substantial 

Hazards, or CEPs exist with respect to the release. 

 

The results of soil samples collected at monitoring wells MW-103, MW-104, MW-105, MW-106, and 

MW-107 around and downgradient of the leaking gasoline dispenser discovered in January 2015 indicate 

that the detected concentrations of VPH and ethanol do not exceed applicable RCs and Method 1 

standards. 

 

VPH C5-C8 aliphatic fractions in groundwater samples collected in July and September 2015 from 

monitoring well MW-103, located downgradient of the leaking dispenser, exceeded Method 1 GW-2 

standards.  However, groundwater samples collected at newly installed monitoring wells MW-106 and 

MW-107 in September 2015, located on-Site and downgradient of MW-103, did not contain VPH 

fractions or target analytes at concentrations above the laboratory RDLs or Method 1 GW-1/GW-2/GW-3 

standards.  In addition, VPH constituents have not been reported above the applicable Method 1 standards 

in the groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells MW-104 and MW-105 during the quarterly 

sampling events conducted in March, June, and September 2015. 

 

Concentrations of APH in the soil gas samples collected during September 2015 from the soil gas points 

installed beneath the concrete slab floor within on-Site convenience store did not exceed the MassDEP 

residential and commercial/industrial values for sub-slab soil gas. 

 

At this time, ECS recommends continuation of quarterly groundwater sampling for VPH at all on-Site 

monitoring wells, and the collection of soil gas samples for APH analysis at existing soil gas points 

during the winter of 2015/2016.
