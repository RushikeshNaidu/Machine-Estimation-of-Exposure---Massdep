1.0 INTRODUCTION 

Arcadia Technology, Inc. (Arcadia) has prepared this Immediate Response Action (IRA) Status 

Report for IRA activities being conducted under Release Tracking Number (RTN) 2-17651.  This 

report has been prepared on behalf of Fremont Loft Condominium Trust in accordance with the 

Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) (310 CMR 40) for a release (the Release) discovered at 

the property located at 158 – 160 Fremont Street in Worcester, Massachusetts (the Subject 

Property), as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2a.  This status report covers the period between 

December 8, 2016 and May 31, 2017.  The Immediate Response Actions being conducted under 

RTN 2-17651 are the subject of this report.     

The vapor intrusion impacts which are the subject of IRA activities for RTN 2-17651 are related 

to a prior Release to the subsurface first reported by The Abrams Group in December 2004.  At 

that time concentrations of compounds above applicable MCP Reportable Concentrations (RCs) 

were first identified in the groundwater at the Subject Property during assessment conducted for 

financing purposes in conjunction with the purchase of the property.  The Release was reported as 

a 120-day reporting condition to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection 

(MassDEP) on April 29, 2005 and RTN 2-15725 was assigned to the Release.  A second RTN, 

RTN 2-17651 was assigned in September 17, 2009 for a potential condition of Imminent release 

migration (SRM) which exists on site due to presence of chlorinated volatile organic compounds 

(CVOCs) detected in indoor air that were also present in the soil gas. A third RTN, RTN 2-18748, 

was assigned on November 15, 2012 for a condition that could pose an imminent hazard (IH) in 

Unit 102 of 158 – 160 Fremont Street in Worcester, Massachusetts; RTN 2-18748 later was 

expanded in January and February 2013 to include conditions that could pose an IH in units 221 

and 242.  These IH conditions and the associated condition of SRM are related to oils and/or 

hazardous materials (OHMs) associated with RTN 2-15725.  RTN 2-17651 and RTN 2-18748 

have both been linked to RTN 2-15725.  

The objective of this IRA Status Report is to document activities which have occurred since the 

submittal of the Dec. 8, 2016 IRA Status Report.  This IRA Status Report fulfills the criteria 

outlined in the MCP at 310 CMR 40.0425 and meets the required submittal frequency for IRA 

Status Reports of every six months.  The Immediate Response Action (IRA) Transmittal Form 

(BWSC 105) required with this report was electronically submitted to MassDEP.  A copy of this 

form is included as Appendix A in the hard copy of this report; electronic copies were directly 

uploaded to the eDEP website.  The Potentially Responsible Party (PRP), Fremont Loft 



Fremont Loft Condominiums  158-160 Fremont St. Worcester, MA 
RTN 2-17651  June 19, 2017 

Page 2

Condominium Trust, has authorized Mr. Ronald K. Burns LSP #9492 to act as agent for RTN 2-

17651 in accordance with the 310 CMR 40.0009(2); a copy of the authorization letter is also 

included in Appendix A.   

1.1 REASON FOR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACTIONS 

In accordance with 310 CMR 40.0412(1) and 310 CMR 40.0412(2) IRAs shall be conducted at 

sites or vessels where a release or threat of release of oil and/or hazardous material has occurred 

which requires notification to the Department under the Two-Hour notification provision of 310 

CMR 40.0311 or 40.0312, or the 72 Hour notification provisions of 310 CMR 40.0313 or 40.0314.   

On September 17, 2009 MassDEP was notified that a condition of SRM existed on site due to 

presence of CVOCs detected in indoor air that were also present in the soil gas.  MassDEP assigned 

a RTN 2-17651 and requested an IRA Plan be performed.  In January 2010, 160 Fremont Street 

Associates, LLC submitted a Release Notification Form (RNF), Immediate Response Action 

(IRA) Plan, and Notice of RTN Being Linked to a Tier Classified Site.   

On November 15, 2012 MassDEP was notified that a condition which could pose an IH existed on 

site due to concentrations of trichloroethylene (TCE) being detected at concentrations above 2 

ug/m3 in Unit 102 during the August 2012 indoor air sampling event.  (At the time 2 ug/m3 was 

the concentration which MassDEP identified as posing an IH condition for women of childbearing 

age in a residential exposure scenario; MassDEP increased this concentration to 6 ug/m3 on March 

27, 2014.)  MassDEP assigned a RTN 2-18748 and verbally approved the installation of an Austin 

Air Filter in Unit 102.  Conditions that could pose an IH were subsequently identified in units 221 

and 242 based on air sampling conducted in these units in January and February 2013 and the 

occupants of these units including women of childbearing age.  MassDEP was notified of these 

additional possible IH conditions on January 23, 2013 and February 20, 2013 respectively and 

incorporated the possible IH conditions in 221 and 242 into RTN 2-18748.  All on-going response 

actions (principally operation and monitoring of SSD systems for Units 102, and 221/242) related 

to the mitigation of the IH condition identified by RTN 2-18748 are being conducted as part of the 

Immediate Response Actions for RTN 2-17651.

• IRA Status Report – Dec. 8, 2016 

Activities previously conducted to address the Release were discussed in these reports.   

3.0 IRA ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED FROM DECEMBER 8, 2016 TO MAY 

31, 2017 

From December 8, 2016 to May 31, 2017 IRA Activities to address the condition of SRM and the 

associated condition that could pose an IH in units 102, 221, and 242 have included significant 

additional assessment activities and monitoring and operation of the SSD system.  These activities 

included SSD system operation and repair and repair indoor air sampling.  The condominium units 

that where air samples were collected are shown the historical Air and Soil Gas Sampling locations 

on figures 2b and 2c.  Laboratory analytical data collected during the period covered by this report 

has been summarized in the attached tables.  Complete laboratory analytical reports for samples 

collected during the period covered by this report are attached to this report as Appendix B.  

Complete Summary Tables and Laboratory Reports for prior sampling were submitted within 

previous MassDEP report submittals.   

3.1 METHODOLOGIES 

The methodologies utilized by Arcadia to conduct these activities are described within this section 

of the report. 

3.1.1 SSD System Operation  

The comprehensive SSD system consists of a total of 14 SSD systems installed throughout the first 

and second floor of the building.  Each system consists of one fan and one or two extraction points, 

the locations of which are shown on Figure 2b and Figure2c, connected with two to four-inch 

diameter, schedule 40 PVC piping.  Three different fan types were utilized: RadonAway Model 

HS 5000, RadonAway Model GP 501, and the FanTech FR225.  Each system was vented above 

the roof line of the one story portion of the building.  The following table lists the system ID, the 

units in which the extraction points are located, and the fan type utilized for each system.

A Dwyer magnehelic gauge is installed prior to the fan within each system to monitor the system’s 

performance.  System A has been operating continuously since February 12, 2013 and System B 

has been operating continuously since March 20, 2013.  Systems 1 through 12 were started on 

December 5, 2013.  All 14 systems were operating continuously throughout the period covered by 

this report with the exception of System 8 which is discussed in the following section. 

3.1.2 SSD System Repair 

. 

On April 6, 2017, during an on-site inspection of the SSD system an Arcadia Representative 

observed that System 8’s pressure gauge indicated that the system had no vacuum pressure gauge. 

The cause of for the reading could be for a variety of reasons: gauge failure, lack of power, plug 

in system, failure of fan motor. All the other gauges for the other systems were functioning and 

there was no disconnect for vacuum piping to the gauge for system 8. Arcadia checked the circuit 

breaker/power panel on April 7, 2017 and the circuit breaker appeared OK. Arcadia then contacted 



Fremont Loft Condominiums  158-160 Fremont St. Worcester, MA 
RTN 2-17651  June 19, 2017 

Page 6

Alpine Environmental (original installer) to come and inspect and repair the system. On April 17, 

2017, an Alpine Environmental technician came to the site and found that the fan motor for System 

8 had failed.  The technician replaced the entire fan unit (Radon Away GP501). He restarted the 

system and the fan operated properly. The pressure gauge had a reading of 0.35 inches of water 

which is the normal range for the system. 

3.1.3 Air Sampling 

Two Air sampling events were performed during the period covered by this report.  The first event 

was on April 7, 2017. Air samples were collected from units 102, 221 and 242, to obtain annual 

indoor air data during the winter/early spring months (worst case scenario) to confirm that the SSD 

system is still mitigating exposures.  The outside temperature at the time of sampling event was in 

the mid 30ºs F versus low 70ºs F inside the condominium units. This differential is consistent with 

the guidance for worst case sampling scenarios in MassDEP guidance on Vapor Intrusions(WSC-

16-435). These units represent the units that have historically been impacted by the vapor intrusion 

from the Release. 

The second event was conducted on May 5th and 12th, 2017. The air samples were collected from 

units 233 and 235.  System 8 covers these units.  Therefore, in accordance with MassDEP guidance 

air samples were collected to confirm that System 8 was functioning properly following the repair. 

The air samples were collected via SUMMA canisters over a 24-hour period.  To collect the air 

samples, the canister valves were opened and following the sampling interval, the valves were 

shut.  Vacuum readings were collected immediately after opening the regulator valve and before 

closing the valve.  Indoor air samples were placed at breathing level at approximately three to five 

feet off the ground.  All air samples were submitted for laboratory analysis of air toxics by United 

States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method TO-15. 

3.2 LABORATORY ANALYTICAL DATA AND FIELD DATA REVIEW 

During this period Arcadia performed SSD system operation repairs and air sampling.  The 

laboratory analytical data and field data obtained from these activities are described within this 

section of the report.

3.2.1 SSD System Monitoring Results 

Operation and maintenance of the comprehensive SSD system will minimally consist of annual 

checks of the systems for pressure drops and fan operation until the system is no longer necessary 

as recommended by MassDEP’s October 2014 Vapor Intrusion Guidance: Public Review Draft.  

To comply with the annual check of the system CHA monitored the magnehelic gauges for the 

SSD systems on April 6, 2017, the gauges of all 14 SSD systems were monitored.  The gauge 

readings of each system were consistent compared to previous monitoring events except for 

System 8 which was repaired.  Gauge readings across the various systems varied from 0.35 to 20 

in H2O; these variations are due to the differences in the fan types, soil types, and number of 

extraction points for the various individual SSD systems.   

3.2.2 Air Sampling Results 

The air samples collected during the period of this report were submitted for analysis of VOCs via 

EPA method TO-15.  The laboratory results were evaluated based on the ten VOCs identified as 

chemicals of potential concern (COPCs) in the December 13, 2012 Action Level Development for 

Indoor Air prepared by LaGoy Risk Analysis, Inc.: 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-

Trimethybenzene, 2- Butanone (MEK), Benzene, Chloroform, cis-1,2-Dichloroethene (cis-DCE), 

Tetrachloroethene(PCE), trans-1,2-Dichloroethene, TCE, and Trichlorofluoromethane (Freon 11).  

This sampling was conducted under RTN 2-17651 to obtain indoor air data.  Laboratory results 

were compared to the Residential Threshold Value (TVr) presented in Table I-D of the MassDEP’s 

October 2016 Vapor Intrusion Guidance: (WSC# 16-435).  None of the COPCs were detected 

above TVrs.  A comparison of sampling results with TVrs serves as an initial screening method 

for determining compounds that pose a potential concern under current site conditions and/or could 

be associated with vapor intrusion.  In conclusion, the results indicate that the SSD systems at the 

Site are mitigating the vapor intrusion from the Release. 

3.3 REMEDIATION WASTE 

 Remediation waste was generated at the Site during this reporting period.  Excess soil/drill cutting 

from the drilling activities conducted by CHA were placed in 3, 55-gallon drums and placed on 

paved area on the west side of the building. The remediation waste was transported under 

hazardous waste manifest by a New England Disposal Technologies, a licensed contractor for 

disposal at a permitted facility. Please see attached hazardous waste manifest and associated 

documents is attached in Appendix C.

3.4 PERMITS & APPROVALS 

No permits or approvals were required for the IRAs conducted within this report. 

4.0 EVALUATION OF CRITICAL EXPOSURE PATHWAYS, 

SUBSTANTIAL RELEASE MIGRATION, AND IMMINENT 

HAZARD CONDITIONS 

As part of on-going IRA activities an evaluation of potential IRA conditions was performed to 

determine if additional immediate actions are required.  The potential IRA conditions evaluated 

are Conditions of Substantial Release Migration (SRM), Critical Exposure Pathways (CEPs), and 

Imminent Hazards (IH).  These conditions all represent conditions with increased exposure and/or 

increased risk due to exposure.  These conditions were most recently evaluated within the 

December 14, 2014 IRA Status Report to identify any possible IRA conditions and to address these 

conditions if they are identified.  As part of the ongoing IRA activities at the Site, Arcadia will 

continue to evaluate these conditions as additional data is collected.  Updates to the status of these 

conditions since the submittal of the December 14, 2014 IRA Status Report are discussed below.   

4.1 SUBSTANTIAL RELEASE MIGRATION 

There have been no changes to the status of conditions of SRM during the period covered by this 

report.  

4.2 CRITICAL EXPOSURE PATHWAYS 

There have been no changes to the status of CEPs during the period covered by this report.   

4.3 IMMINENT HAZARD EVALUATION 

There have been no changes to the status of IHs during the period covered by this report. 

5.0 NEW SITE INFORMATION 

No Significant new site information or data other than the activities discussed in previous 

sections has been obtained during the period covered by this report.

5. Values with the < Symbol before it are less than the Laboratory Detection Limits and the Laboratory Detection Limit is shown
6.  * indicates that the Suma canister could not be shutdown after 24 hours
7. Subslab Depressurization Systems were actived proximal to unit 102 on February 12, 2013 and proximal to units 221 and 224 on March 20, 2013.

8. Building-wide SSDS was activated December 5, 2013.

2.  The TVr are based on Typical Indoor Air Concentrations and MCP risk management criteria.  It can generally be concluded that residential indoor air samples with contaminant concentrations less than their TVr indicate 

that the vapor intrusion pathway is unlikely to be of concern under current site conditions and use.

NOTES:
1.  TVr (Residential Threshold Values) were taken from Table I.A of MassDEP's October 2016 Vapor Intrusion Guidance(WSC-16-435)

3.  NS = no TV available, C&C = Coler & Colantonio, Inc., Loitherstein =Loitherstein Environmental, Inc. 
4. Bolded values exceed the TV.
5. Values with the < Symbol before it are less than the Laboratory Detection Limits and the Laboratory Detection Limit is shown
6.  * indicates that the Suma canister could not be shutdown after 24 hours
7. Subslab Depressurization Systems were actived proximal to unit 102 on February 12, 2013 and proximal to units 221 and 224 on March 20, 2013.

8. Building-wide SSDS was activated December 5, 2013.

2.  The TVr are based on Typical Indoor Air Concentrations and MCP risk management criteria.  It can generally be concluded that residential indoor air samples with 

contaminant concentrations less than their TVr indicate that the vapor intrusion pathway is unlikely to be of concern under current site conditions and use.

Case Narrative

The samples were received in accordance with the Chain of Custody and no significant deviations were encountered during the preparation 

or analysis unless otherwise noted. Sample Receipt, Container Information, and the Chain of Custody are located at the back of the report.

Results contained within this report relate only to the samples submitted under this Alpha Lab Number and meet NELAP requirements for all 

NELAP accredited parameters unless otherwise noted in the following narrative. The data presented in this report is organized by parameter 

(i.e. VOC, SVOC, etc.). Sample specific Quality Control data (i.e. Surrogate Spike Recovery) is reported at the end of the target analyte list 

for each individual sample, followed by the Laboratory Batch Quality Control at the end of each parameter. Tentatively Identified Compounds

(TICs), if requested, are reported for compounds identified to be present and are not part of the method/program Target Compound List, 

even if only a subset of the TCL are being reported. If a sample was re-analyzed or re-extracted due to a required quality control corrective 

action and if both sets of data are reported, the Laboratory ID of the re-analysis or re-extraction is designated with an "R" or "RE", 

respectively. When multiple Batch Quality Control elements are reported (e.g. more than one LCS), the associated samples for each element

are noted in the grey shaded header line of each data table. Any Laboratory Batch, Sample Specific % recovery or RPD value that is outside

the listed Acceptance Criteria is bolded in the report. All specific QC information is also incorporated in the Data Usability format of our Data 

Merger tool where it can be reviewed along with any associated usability implications. Soil/sediments, solids and tissues are reported on a 

dry weight basis unless otherwise noted. Definitions of all data qualifiers and acronyms used in this report are provided in the Glossary 

located at the back of the report. 

In reference to questions H (CAM) or 4 (RCP) when "NO" is checked, the performance criteria for CAM and RCP methods allow for some 

quality control failures to occur and still be within method compliance.  In these instances the specific failure is not narrated but noted in the 

associated QC table. The information is also incorporated in the Data Usability format of our Data Merger tool where it can be reviewed 

along with any associated usability implications.

Please see the associated ADEx data file for a comparison of laboratory reporting limits that were achieved with the regulatory Numerical 

Standards requested on the Chain of Custody.

HOLD POLICY

For samples submitted on hold, Alpha's policy is to hold samples (with the exception of Air canisters) free of charge for 21 calendar days 

from the date the project is completed. After 21 calendar days, we will dispose of all samples submitted including those put on hold unless 

you have contacted your Client Service Representative and made arrangements for Alpha to continue to hold the samples. Air canisters will 

be disposed after 3 business days from the date the project is completed.

Please contact Client Services at 800-624-9220 with any questions.

In reference to question G:

One or more of the target analytes did not achieve the requested CAM reporting limits. 

Sample L1711018-02 and -03 results for Acetone should be considered estimated due to co-elution with a 

non-target peak.

The analyte was detected above the reporting limit in the associated method blank. Flag only applies to associated field samples that 
have detectable concentrations of the analyte at less than ten times (10x) the concentration found in the blank. For MCP-related 
projects, flag only applies to associated field samples that have detectable concentrations of the analyte at less than ten times (10x) 
the concentration found in the blank. For DOD-related projects, flag only applies to associated field samples that have detectable 
concentrations of the analyte at less than ten times (10x) the concentration found in the blank AND the analyte was detected above 
one-half the reporting limit (or above the reporting limit for common lab contaminants) in the associated method blank. For NJ-
Air-related projects, flag only applies to associated field samples that have detectable concentrations of the analyte above the 
reporting limit. For NJ-related projects (excluding Air), flag only applies to associated field samples that have detectable 
concentrations of the analyte, which was detected above the reporting limit in the associated method blank or above five times the

Co-elution: The target analyte co-elutes with a known lab standard (i.e. surrogate, internal standards, etc.) for co-extracted 
analyses.
Concentration of analyte was quantified from diluted analysis. Flag only applies to field samples that have detectable concentrations 
of the analyte.
Concentration of analyte exceeds the range of the calibration curve and/or linear range of the instrument.

The concentration may be biased high due to matrix interferences (i.e, co-elution) with non-target compound(s). The result should 
be considered estimated.
The analysis of pH was performed beyond the regulatory-required holding time of 15 minutes from the time of sample collection.

The lower value for the two columns has been reported due to obvious interference.

Reporting Limit (RL) exceeds the MCP CAM Reporting Limit for this analyte.

Case Narrative

The samples were received in accordance with the Chain of Custody and no significant deviations were encountered during the preparation 

or analysis unless otherwise noted. Sample Receipt, Container Information, and the Chain of Custody are located at the back of the report.

Results contained within this report relate only to the samples submitted under this Alpha Lab Number and meet NELAP requirements for all 

NELAP accredited parameters unless otherwise noted in the following narrative. The data presented in this report is organized by parameter 

(i.e. VOC, SVOC, etc.). Sample specific Quality Control data (i.e. Surrogate Spike Recovery) is reported at the end of the target analyte list 

for each individual sample, followed by the Laboratory Batch Quality Control at the end of each parameter. Tentatively Identified Compounds

(TICs), if requested, are reported for compounds identified to be present and are not part of the method/program Target Compound List, 

even if only a subset of the TCL are being reported. If a sample was re-analyzed or re-extracted due to a required quality control corrective 

action and if both sets of data are reported, the Laboratory ID of the re-analysis or re-extraction is designated with an "R" or "RE", 

respectively. When multiple Batch Quality Control elements are reported (e.g. more than one LCS), the associated samples for each element

are noted in the grey shaded header line of each data table. Any Laboratory Batch, Sample Specific % recovery or RPD value that is outside

the listed Acceptance Criteria is bolded in the report. All specific QC information is also incorporated in the Data Usability format of our Data 

Merger tool where it can be reviewed along with any associated usability implications. Soil/sediments, solids and tissues are reported on a 

dry weight basis unless otherwise noted. Definitions of all data qualifiers and acronyms used in this report are provided in the Glossary 

located at the back of the report. 

In reference to questions H (CAM) or 4 (RCP) when "NO" is checked, the performance criteria for CAM and RCP methods allow for some 

quality control failures to occur and still be within method compliance.  In these instances the specific failure is not narrated but noted in the 

associated QC table. The information is also incorporated in the Data Usability format of our Data Merger tool where it can be reviewed 

along with any associated usability implications.

Please see the associated ADEx data file for a comparison of laboratory reporting limits that were achieved with the regulatory Numerical 

Standards requested on the Chain of Custody.

Co-elution: The target analyte co-elutes with a known lab standard (i.e. surrogate, internal standards, etc.) for co-extracted 
analyses.
Concentration of analyte was quantified from diluted analysis. Flag only applies to field samples that have detectable concentrations 
of the analyte.
Concentration of analyte exceeds the range of the calibration curve and/or linear range of the instrument.

The concentration may be biased high due to matrix interferences (i.e, co-elution) with non-target compound(s). The result should 
be considered estimated.
The analysis of pH was performed beyond the regulatory-required holding time of 15 minutes from the time of sample collection.

Dear Mr. Carlson: 

Arcadia Technology, Inc. is writing to notify you, in accordance with 310 CMR 40.1403(10) of 
the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP), that environmental indoor air sampling was 
conducted at the above referenced property on Thursday April 6th, 2017.   

This sampling is being conducted as part of Immediate Response Actions to address the release 
identified as Massachusetts Department of Environment Protection (MassDEP) Release 
Tracking Number (RTN) 2-18748, 2-17651 and 2-15725 located at 160 Fremont Street in 
Worcester, Massachusetts.  This sampling event is part of the routine operation and 
maintenance activities being performed as part of Immediate Response Actions. 

A copy of reports documenting remedial activities and conditions at the Site are available for 
review online at http://public.dep.state.ma.us/SearchableSites2/Search.aspx or by contacting 
Arcadia Technology, Inc. The attached Notice of Environmental Sampling is required by 
MassDEP.  Laboratory results of the indoor air sampling is also attached. They have been 
provided within 30 days of the laboratory report being issued.  Public involvement 
opportunities are available under 310 CMR 40.1403(9). 

An indoor air sample was collected and analyzed to confirm that the sub-slab depressurization 
(SSD) system is adequately preventing potentially harmful vapor from migrating into the 
residential units. The results of the indoor air sampling within your unit have demonstrated that 
a condition of no substantial hazard exists within your unit. This means that the compound 
related to the Release have been reduced to concentrations which do not pose a significant risk 
of harm to health, safety, public welfare or the environment.

Arcadia Technology, Inc.

Mr. Russell Cournoyer 
65 Lake Avenue, Unit 228 
Worcester, MA 01604  

Re: Notice of Environmental Sampling Results 
160 Fremont Street Unit 102 
Worcester, Massachusetts 01604 

Dear Mr. Cournoyer: 

Arcadia Technology, Inc. is writing to notify you, in accordance with 310 CMR 40.1403(10) of 
the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP), that environmental indoor air sampling was 
conducted at the above referenced property on Thursday April 6th, 2017.   

This sampling is being conducted as part of Immediate Response Actions to address the release 
identified as Massachusetts Department of Environment Protection (MassDEP) Release 
Tracking Number (RTN) 2-18748, 2-17651 and 2-15725 located at 160 Fremont Street in 
Worcester, Massachusetts.  This sampling event is part of the routine operation and 
maintenance activities being performed as part of Immediate Response Actions. 

A copy of reports documenting remedial activities and conditions at the Site are available for 
review online at http://public.dep.state.ma.us/SearchableSites2/Search.aspx or by contacting 
Arcadia Technology, Inc. The attached Notice of Environmental Sampling is required by 
MassDEP.  Laboratory results of the indoor air sampling is also attached. They have been 
provided within 30 days of the laboratory report being issued.  Public involvement 
opportunities are available under 310 CMR 40.1403(9). 

An indoor air sample was collected and analyzed to confirm that the sub-slab depressurization 
(SSD) system is adequately preventing potentially harmful vapor from migrating into the 
residential units. The results of the indoor air sampling within your unit have demonstrated that 
a condition of no substantial hazard exists within your unit. This means that the compound 
related to the Release have been reduced to concentrations which do not pose a significant risk 
of harm to health, safety, public welfare or the environment. 

Sincerely, 
Arcadia Technology, Inc.

Re: Notice of Environmental Sampling Results 
160 Fremont Street Unit 233

Dear Mr. Mujeeb: 

Arcadia Technology, Inc. is writing to notify you, in accordance with 310 CMR 40.1403(10) of 
the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP), that environmental indoor air sampling was 
conducted at the above referenced property on Friday May 12th, 2017.   

This sampling is being conducted as part of Immediate Response Actions to address the release 
identified as Massachusetts Department of Environment Protection (MassDEP) Release 
Tracking Number (RTN) 2-18748, 2-17651 and 2-15725 located at 160 Fremont Street in 
Worcester, Massachusetts.  This sampling event is part of the testing following the repair of the 
sub-slab depressurization system being performed as part of Immediate Response Actions. 

A copy of reports documenting remedial activities and conditions at the Site are available for 
review online at http://public.dep.state.ma.us/SearchableSites2/Search.aspx or by contacting 
Arcadia Technology, Inc. The attached Notice of Environmental Sampling is required by 
MassDEP.  Laboratory results of the indoor air sampling is also attached. They have been 
provided within 30 days of the laboratory report being issued.  Public involvement 
opportunities are available under 310 CMR 40.1403(9). 

An indoor air sample was collected and analyzed to confirm that the sub-slab depressurization 
(SSD) system is adequately preventing potentially harmful vapor from migrating into the 
residential units. This was done following the repair of SSD system 8 fan unit. The results of 
the indoor air sampling within your unit have demonstrated that a condition of no substantial 
hazard exists within your unit. This means that the compounds related to the Release have been 
reduced to concentrations which do not pose a significant risk of harm to health, safety, public 
welfare or the environment.

Arcadia Technology, Inc.

Mr. William Stone 
11144 Huntington Meadow Lan 
Charlotte, NC 28273  

Re: Notice of Environmental Sampling Results 
160 Fremont Street Unit 235 
Worcester, Massachusetts 01604 

Dear Mr. Stone: 

Arcadia Technology, Inc. is writing to notify you, in accordance with 310 CMR 40.1403(10) of 
the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP), that environmental indoor air sampling was 
conducted at the above referenced property on Saturday May 6th, 2017.   

This sampling is being conducted as part of Immediate Response Actions to address the release 
identified as Massachusetts Department of Environment Protection (MassDEP) Release 
Tracking Number (RTN) 2-18748, 2-17651 and 2-15725 located at 160 Fremont Street in 
Worcester, Massachusetts.  This sampling event is part of the testing following the repair of the 
sub-slab depressurization system being performed as part of Immediate Response Actions. 

A copy of reports documenting remedial activities and conditions at the Site are available for 
review online at http://public.dep.state.ma.us/SearchableSites2/Search.aspx or by contacting 
Arcadia Technology, Inc. The attached Notice of Environmental Sampling is required by 
MassDEP.  Laboratory results of the indoor air sampling is also attached. They have been 
provided within 30 days of the laboratory report being issued.  Public involvement 
opportunities are available under 310 CMR 40.1403(9). 

An indoor air sample was collected and analyzed to confirm that the sub-slab depressurization 
(SSD) system is adequately preventing potentially harmful vapor from migrating into the 
residential units. This was done following the repair of SSD system 8 fan unit. The results of 
the indoor air sampling within your unit have demonstrated that a condition of no substantial 
hazard exists within your unit. This means that the compounds related to the Release have been 
reduced to concentrations which do not pose a significant risk of harm to health, safety, public 
welfare or the environment. 

Sincerely, 
Arcadia Technology, Inc.

Re: Notice of Environmental Sampling 
160 Fremont Street Units: 102, 221, 233, 235 and 242 
Worcester, Massachusetts 01604 

Dear Mr. Hirsh: 

Arcadia Technology, Inc. is writing to notify you, in accordance with 310 CMR 40.1403(3) of 
the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP), that environmental indoor air sampling has been 
conducted at the above referenced property on April 7, May 5 and May 12, 2017.   

This sampling was conducted as part of Immediate Response Actions to address the release 
identified as Massachusetts Department of Environment Protection (MassDEP) Release 
Tracking Number (RTN) 2-18748, 2-17651 and 2-15725 located at 160 Fremont Street in 
Worcester, Massachusetts.  The sampling of units 102, 221 and 242 is an annual sampling event 
that is part of routine operation and maintenance activities being performed as part of 
Immediate Response Actions.  The sampling of units 233 and 235 was performed after a repair 
of the sub-slab depressurization system. 

The indoor air samples were collected and analyzed to confirm that the sub-slab 
depressurization (SSD) system is adequately preventing potentially harmful vapor from 
migrating into the residential units. The results of the indoor air sampling within all units tested 
have demonstrated that a condition of no substantial hazard exists within all units. This means 
that the compounds related to the Release have been reduced to concentrations which do not 
pose a significant risk of harm to health, safety, public welfare or the environment 

A copy of reports documenting remedial activities and conditions at the Site are available for 
review online at http://public.dep.state.ma.us/SearchableSites2/Search.aspx or by contacting

the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP), that environmental indoor air sampling has been 
conducted at the above referenced property on April 7, May 5 and May 12, 2017.   

This sampling was conducted as part of Immediate Response Actions to address the release 
identified as Massachusetts Department of Environment Protection (MassDEP) Release 
Tracking Number (RTN) 2-18748, 2-17651 and 2-15725 located at 160 Fremont Street in 
Worcester, Massachusetts.  The sampling of units 102, 221 and 242 is an annual sampling event 
that is part of routine operation and maintenance activities being performed as part of 
Immediate Response Actions.  The sampling of units 233 and 235 was performed after a repair 
of the sub-slab depressurization system. 

The indoor air samples were collected and analyzed to confirm that the sub-slab 
depressurization (SSD) system is adequately preventing potentially harmful vapor from 
migrating into the residential units. The results of the indoor air sampling within all units tested 
have demonstrated that a condition of no substantial hazard exists within all units. This means 
that the compounds related to the Release have been reduced to concentrations which do not 
pose a significant risk of harm to health, safety, public welfare or the environment 

A copy of reports documenting remedial activities and conditions at the Site are available for 
review online at http://public.dep.state.ma.us/SearchableSites2/Search.aspx or by contacting 
Arcadia Technology, Inc.  

Sincerely, 
Arcadia Technology, Inc. 

Ronald Burns, LSP

APPENDIX E 

Statement of Limitations 



STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS 
The report will be for the sole use of the Client – Responsible Party, current owner of the property and prospective owner of the 
property and endorsed financial companies.  Any reuse or reliance on this report by third parties is prohibited and shall only be 
done with the prior written consent of Arcadia Technology, Inc. (ARCADIA).   
Reasonable care will be exercised in locating underground structures in the vicinity of proposed subsurface explorations.  This will 
include contact with the local agency coordinating subsurface utility information and a review of plans provided by you or your 
representatives for the site to be investigated.  ARCADIA will not be liable for any damages due to unmarked or improperly marked 
utilities.   
ARCADIA represents that ARCADIA conducted its assessment of the site and prepared the report in accordance with the 
professional and industry standards prevailing at the time such services were rendered.  The observations described in this report 
were made under the conditions and dates stated herein.  The conclusions presented in the report were based solely upon the services 
described herein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of services or the time and budgetary constraints 
imposed by.  The work described in this report was carried out in accordance with the Terms & Conditions of Engagement.     
In preparing this report, ARCADIA has relied on certain information provided by federal, state, local government officials and 
their files as well as other parties referenced herein available to ARCADIA at the time of the investigation. ARCADIA did not 
attempt to independently verify the accuracy or completeness of all information received during the course of this project. 
ARCADIA is not responsible for the accuracy of information provided by others.   
In the event that another consultant, regulatory agency, bank counsel or title examiner for Client obtains information on 
environmental or hazardous waste issues at the site not contained in this report, such information should be brought to the attention 
of ARCADIA forthwith.  ARCADIA will evaluate such information and, on the basis of this evaluation, may modify the 
conclusions stated in this report.   
Observations were made of the site and of structures on the site only on those dates as indicated within this report. Where access 
to portions of the site was unavailable or limited, ARCADIA renders no opinion as to the presence of hazardous material or oil, or 
to the presence of indirect evidence relating to hazardous material or oil, in that portion of the site.    
The conclusions contained in this report are based in part upon the data obtained from a limited number of soil and/or groundwater 
samples obtained from the site.  The nature and extent of variations between these samples may not become evident without further 
exploration.  If variations or other latent conditions then appear evident, it will be necessary to reevaluate the conclusions of this 
report.  Where quantitative laboratory testing was performed as part of the site assessment, such analyses have been conducted by 
an independent laboratory.  ARCADIA has relied upon the data provided.  Chemical analyses have been performed for specific 
parameters during the course of this investigation, as described in the text.  However, additional chemical constituents not searched 
for during the current study may be present in soil and/or groundwater at the site.   
The conclusions and recommendations contained in this report are based in part upon various types of chemical data and are 
contingent upon their validity. These data have been reviewed and interpretations made in the report.  Moreover, it should be noted 
that variations in the types and concentrations of contaminants and variations in their flow paths may occur due to seasonal water 
table fluctuations, past disposal practices, the passage of time, and other factors.   
The data presented in the report and our opinions based on this data are provided in accordance with our Proposal for Professional 
Services, which is incorporated by reference. The services were performed in a manner consistent with that degree of skill and care 
ordinarily exercised by practicing design professionals performing similar services in the same locality, at the same site and under 
the same or similar circumstances and conditions.   
No warranty is expressed or implied regarding the potential for additional work to be required regarding Regulatory (DEP or EPA) 
additional assessment, remediation, requirements or recommendations of any regulatory Audit Findings, Notices of 
Noncompliance, Administrative Consent Orders or any other regulator agency requirements or recommendations.  ARCADIA is 
not responsible to meet any Regulatory Deadlines, Regulatory Compliance Fees, or delayed or late Regulatory submittals that 
generate supplementary compliance fees.    
Client agrees to pay ARCADIA costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) for defending ARCADIA against any claims that a 
third party or a regulatory agency asserts against ARCADIA related to the Services that were provided to Client. Claims include 
legal actions by a third party or a regulatory agency that are based upon the discoveries, findings or conclusions disclosed in 
documents or reports supplied to Client by ARCADIA.
