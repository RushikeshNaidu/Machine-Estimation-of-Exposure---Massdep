1.0 OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, LIMITATIONS AND RELIANCE

1.1 OBJECTIVE

Environmental Compliance Services, Inc. (ECS) performed an ASTM Phase I and Phase II
Environmental Site Assessment of 183 Turnpike Road, in Westborough, Massachusetts (the Site). The
purpose of ECS's investigation was to identify and record existing, potential or suspected conditions that
may impose an environmental liability to, or restrict the use of the property1 and to identify evidence of a
release or a potential release of oil and hazardous materials (OHM), as defined by the Massachusetts Oil
and Hazardous Materials Release Prevention and Response Act, Chapter 21E of the Massachusetts
General Laws or the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (310 CMR 40.0000).

1.2 SCOPE OF WORK AND LIMITATIONS

The assessment was performed at the request of Mr. Joseph Campisi of Warren Equities, Inc. in
accordance with the project Scope of Services dated January 4, 2010 and change orders dated February 4,
2010 and February 22, 2010. This assessment conforms to American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) Standard E1527-05 (Standard Practice for Environmental Assessments of Commercial
Properties: Phase I Assessment Process). The scope of work has not been expanded to include business
environmental risks as defined by ASTM Standard Practice E 1527-05. No air, building material, or
waste sampling was performed. There were no significant deviations from the ASTM requirements.

1.3 RELIANCE

This report was prepared for Warren Equities, Inc. (the User of this report as defined by ASTM) and is
not to be relied upon by any other party without the written authorization of ECS. Use and/or reliance on
this report are subject to all limitations specified in ASTM Stand Practice E 1527-05 and/or as specifically
noted in the report itself.

1 This includes identifying “Recognized Environmental Conditions”, as defined in ASTM E1527-05. This term will be used to
mean the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substance or petroleum product on the site under conditions that indicate
an existing release, a past release or a material threat of a release into structures on the site or into the ground, groundwater or
surface water. The term is not intended to include de minimis conditions that generally do not present a material risk to the public
health or the environment and that generally would not be the subject of an enforcement action if brought to the attention of the
appropriate government agencies.

2.0 PREVIOUS REPORTS

ECS has summarized the available reports associated with the site below.

Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA), IRWIN Engineers, Inc., June 13, 2006

On June 13, 2006 IRWIN Engineers Inc. prepared an ASTM Phase I Environmental Site Assessment for
site, on the behalf of McCarthy Realty, LLC. The purpose of the investigation was to identify the presence
and/or absence of Recognized Environmental Conditions (REC’s).

According to the report, the Site has been utilized as a residence and nursery since Robert McGoldrick
purchased the property in 1950. Prior to 1950 the property was agricultural land.

The Site assessed by Irwin was comprised of Parcel 13 (2.412 acres) and Parcel 13A (1.15 acres) located in
the north central part of the town of Westborough, Massachusetts. The owner of record for Parcel 13 and
Parcel 13 A were listed as Lawrence McGoldrick Trustee and June McGoldrick, respectively. At the time
of the ESA the Site was occupied by one residential structure on Parcel 13A and, on Parcel 13, one
commercial building housing a store, an office, a garage, four greenhouses and a number of storage
structures.

This assessment revealed the following findings:

 The presence of one 10,000-gallon fuel oil underground storage tank (UST) and associated
underground piping on the Parcel 13 portion of the Site, approximately 40-50 years old. The UST
was reported to be abandoned in-place without a permit from the Westborough Fire Department.
The assessment also identified evidence that the UST is currently in use for the accumulation of
waste materials or fuel with the necessary design features required by Fire Prevention Regulations.

 The presence of one 2,000-gallon fuel oil UST associated with the heating system for the single
family residence on the Parcel 13A portion of the Site. The UST was assumed to be single walled
steel and approximately 53 years old.

 Both Parcels were reportedly serviced by septic systems; given the ages of the structures there may
be cesspools associated with the septic systems.

 Documentation at the Fire Department indicated that presences of a 4,000-gallon heating oil UST
dated 1976 and no closure documentation. The owner indicated that the UST was located on
another parcel of land across the street from the Site.

 Documentation at the Fire Department indicated that presences of a 200-gallon gasoline UST dated
1955 with no reference to location and no closure documentation. The owner did not recall
specifics regarding this UST.

The acknowledged practice of disposal of pesticide container rinse waters onto the ground at the property
immediately adjacent to and up gradient from the Site.
IRWIN Engineers concluded that:

 The 10, 000-gallon UST is in noncompliance with the requirements for the abandonment of an UST
and associated piping, in accordance with 527 CMR 9.07(J), and constitutes a REC. IRWIN
recommended that the 10,000-gallon UST and associated piping, which was reportedly abandoned
in place to be removed immediately following the applicable regulations.



 The 2,000-gallon UST was active and the presence of an active UST indicates a potential threat
release of petroleum products and may be considered a potential REC as there are no indication
that the tank system has failed. IRWIN recommended that the 2,000-gallon UST and associated
piping, which was reportedly abandoned in place to be removed immediately following the
applicable regulations.

 Historical records from the Fire Department suggested the possible presence of 4,000-gallon oil and
200-gallon gasoline USTs at the Site maybe suspect as the Site owner had no recollection that they
may or may not be on the Site. If known to be present on the Site, the abandoned USTs would be
considered a REC; however, there is no confirmation that these USTs existed on the Site.

 The acknowledge practice of disposal of pesticide container rinse waters onto the ground at the
property immediately adjacent to and up gradient from the Site where a migrating release might be
expected to flow with groundwater onto the Site. The Site is located within 500 feet of a potential
drinking water supply area and the potential for transport of hazardous materials to that receptor
would have to be considered if a reportable release is discovered on the Site.

Underground Storage Tank Removal Report, IRWIN Engineers, Inc., August 2, 2006

Irwin prepared a report dated August 2, 2006 summarizing the UST removal activities at the Site. Irwin
Engineers, Inc. observed the removal of a 10,000-gallon UST from the Site on July 18, 2006. The UST was
reportedly used to store heating oil for the oil-fired heating system at the nursery. During the Phase I
investigations performed by IRWIN Engineers, the owner of the property indicated that the UST had been
abandoned in place and was not in use. United Industrial Services indicated on a work order dated May 5,
2006, that 2,400-gallons of used motor oil had been pumped out of the UST. Based on the information
stated in the United Industrial Services, Mr. Bob McGoldrick (site owner) confirmed the information on the
work order was correct. Irwin Engineers subsequently notified the Westborough Fire Department that the
UST was not abandoned and was still in use.

At the time of the UST removal, soil samples were collected from the excavation bottom near the area
beneath the fill piping, the south sidewall and from the stockpile of material excavated from around the
UST. Irwin Engineers screened three soil samples for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with a
photoionization detector (PID) , recording no readings higher than 0.4 parts per million (ppm). Samples
were analyzed for the presence of extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH), polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) and RCRA 8 metals, based on the information that the UST was utilized for the storage of used
motor oil rather than heating oil. According to the report, no reportable concentrations of any hydrocarbons,
PCBs, or metals were found based on a comparison to RCS-1 criteria.

Irwin Engineers concluded, that there was no indication of a release to the subsurface at the Site associated
with the 10,000-gallon UST used for heating oil and waste oil storage. Irwin Engineers conclusion was
based on the laboratory results, soils in the excavation indicate no reportable concentrations of oil or
hazardous material (RCS-1) are present in the area from which the UST was removed.

3.2 FIRE DEPARTMENT RECORDS

ECS searched records maintained by the Westborough Fire Department pertaining to USTs and fire
department responses to the Site. No record of spills were found in the files for either property.
Department records indicated that there were no issues with the removal and disposal of USTs removed
from either Parcel 13 or Parcel 13A Site in July 2006 and May 2009, respectively.

Records found in the property files are summarized below:

Parcel 13:

A permit and application dated July 3, 2006 was issued to Mr. McGoldrick at the 185 Turnpike Road
property for the removal of a 10,000-gallon heating oil UST. Additional remarks on the permit indicate
that the UST was allegedly used for the storage of used motor oil.

A hand written note by Fire Chief Walter Perron, dated July 12, 2006 was found in the file referring to the
removal of a UST at the property. No indication of the size or location of the UST was mentioned,
however it was noted that there was no indication of a release associated with the tank.

On July 18, 2006, Firefighter/Inspector Chris Knight of the Westborough Fire Department visited the 185
Turnpike Road (Parcel 13) property at the request of the owner Mr. McGoldrick in order to observe the
UST removal activities at the Green Thumb Nursery. Prior to the arrival of the Fire Department, D.J.
Trucking had excavated an approximately 10,000-gallon heating oil UST, located in the vicinity of the
garage at the southwestern corner of the property. According to the report issued by the Fire Department,
Mr. McGoldrick stated that the tank had not been in use for a number of years and the fill port/connection
had been removed sometime in the past. IRWIN Engineering was onsite in order to collect soil samples
from the tank grave. Mr. Knight mentioned in his report that the tank was in good condition and the
excavation did not exhibit signs of a release.

Parcel 13A (Residential Property):

The Westborough Fire Department issued a fuel storage permit to the 183 Turnpike Road property on
November 18, 1976, for the storage of heating oil in an UST. No indications of size and location of UST
is noted on the permit. At the bottom of the permit there is mention of a 1,000-gallon UST being
removed and replace by a 4,000-gallon UST, November 18, 1977. Based on the previous Phase I report
conducted by IRWIN, Mr. McGoldrick stated that the 4,000-gallon UST was located on the parcel of land
which he owned across Oak Street from the site.

There is also a note that the property had a permit for a 200-gallon gasoline UST, February 9, 1955. Mr.
Goldrick was also interview by IRWIN regarding this UST, as indicated in the IRWIN report Mr.
McGoldrick indicated that an AST was used to fuel trucks.

The Westborough Fire Department had one permit (# 27328) and associated permit application on file for
the removal and transportation of a UST from the 183 Turnpike Road property to JC Tombarello Tank
Yard for disposal.

Firefighter/Inspector Chris Knight, Westborough Fire Department, responded to the 183 Turnpike Road
property (Parcel 13A) on May 13, 2009 in order to observe the removal a 2,000-gallon UST. Prior to Mr.
Knight’s arrival on at the Site, the UST was reportedly unearthed and any liquid was removed by Cyn
Environmental. Cyn Environmental generated a waste material profile form which indicated that
approximately 300-400 gallons of Number 2 Fuel Oil was removed via a vacuum truck. Mr. Knight
noted there did not appear to be any discolored dirt or smell in the excavation area around the UST. The
UST was removed from the Site on May 14, 2009, and shipped to 28 Walcott Street, Readville MA. for
disposal.

Oil Burner – Furnace Cards

The Westborough Fire Department had no records indicating the former use of an oil burner at either of
the residential property or the former Green Thumb Nursery Site.

3.3 SITE IMPROVEMENTS

The Site consists of a two parcels of land, identified as Parcels 13 and Parcel 13A on Map 33 on the
Westborough Assessor’s Map.

Parcel 13:

Parcel 13 is a vacant parcel of land encompassing 2.412 acres of land which was formerly occupied by
the Green Thumb Nursery. Located in the northeast corner of Parcel 13 there is a two bay garage
building and attached storage building. The remaining structures associated with the nursery were
removed from the Site in June 2009. The concrete slab which these structures rested on remain in place.
A building permit dated June 1, 2009 indicated the structures to be removed were the greenhouses and
attached buildings, the existing concrete slab were to remain.

Parcel 13A:

Parcel 13A is a vacant parcel of land encompassing 1.15 acres of vegetated land which was formerly
occupied by a residential dwelling located at the southern portion of the property. A demolition permit
application, dated May 11, 2009 was found at the Westborough Building Department. During the site
reconnaissance, ECS observed the wood frame structure to have been removed and the concrete
foundation and slab remains. Access to the site is also via a short driveway from Woodman Avenue,
border the property to the east. This driveway provides access to the garage portion of the basement. The
majority of the Site is vegetated with a short driveway entering the Site from the east along Woodman
Avenue.

4.0 SITE HISTORY

Information pertaining to site ownership, structures, and usage and storage of oil and/or hazardous
materials was obtained through interviews with knowledgeable parties, reviews of previous reports,
Sanborn Fire Insurance Rate Maps, historical street directories, aerial photographs, historical topographic
maps and miscellaneous site plans when such sources were readily available.

4.1 INTERVIEW SUMMARY

4.1.1 Owner or Knowledgeable Party Interview

ECS was unaccompanied during the Site inspection.

4.1.2 User Questionnaire

The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfield Revitalization Act of 2001 requires that the
user provide certain information to the environmental professional is order to qualify for one or
more of the Landowner Limited Protections. Mr. Allen Hight, representative from Brendon
Properties, was provided a questionnaire. No affirmative responses were made. A copy of the
user questionnaire is included as Appendix C.

4.1.3 Occupant Interview

ECS conducted a telephone interviewed with Mr. Allen Hight, the Brendon Properties
representative. Mr. Hight informed ECS that Brendon Properties purchased the two properties
approximately three years ago. According to the Westborough Tax Assessors office the
last date of purchase was on September 7, 2006, the Grantor was listed as McGoldrick.

The two bay garage building, located at the northeastern corner of Parcel 13 is occupied
by several pieces of landscaping equipment owned by Brendon Properties. Mr. Hight
had no knowledge of hazardous materials being stored in the building. Based on the
conversation with Mr. Hight, ECS was informed that the garage building is unheated and
there are no known floor drains.

Mr. Hight has no information as to the locations of the septic systems associated with the
former Green Thumb Nursery. ECS contacted Mr. Michael Scott, Waterman Design
Associates, Inc. for information regarding the location of the septic system. Waterman
Design Associates, was contracted by Brendon Properties to conduct an survey of the two
parcels, with the prospect of future development.

Waterman Designs provided ECS with an A-1 Survey Map. The detailed map of the site
indicated that there was a septic manhole cover located along the western property boundary.
During the site reconnaissance, ECS personnel could not locate the noted manhole cover.

4.1.4 Other Parties Interviewed

ECS interviewed representatives of the Westborough Assessors, Building, Health, and Fire
Departments. Information obtained from the Fire Department is included in Section 3.2. Property
tax cards were obtained from the Assessors Office.

The Building Department had permits for the following:
 Receipt of Disposal of steel UST; Tombarello & Sons disposal yard for a 1,000-gallon

UST from the Green Thumb property, dated October 23, 2001.
 Receipt of Disposal of steel UST; Tombarello & Sons disposal yard for a 5,000-gallon

UST from the Green Thumb property, dated October 23, 2001.
 Permit for the removal of a 10,000-gallon heating oil UST from the Green Thumb

Nursery property, Parcel 13; dated August 3, 2006.

Parcel 13A; dated May 13, 2009.
 Demolition permits for the demolition of the structures on the Green Thumb Nursery

property, Parcel 13 and the Residential property, Parcel 13A, dated June 2009.

Building Department records indicate that the two Steel USTs were properly disposed of in
October 2001. Based on municipal file reviews, previous environmental reports, and interviews
with the current property owner, there is no indication of the former locations of these USTs.
Based the disposal receipts, ECS determined that the USTs have been removed from the site and
properly disposed of at Tombarello & Sons disposal yard.

ECS made an inquiry at the Board of Health for both properties for potential records including
permits for septic systems, environmental issues at the Site and private drinking water wells on
record in the vicinity of the property.

No files were found for the Residential property, Parcel 13A. However, the Green Thumb filed
contained one complaint on record. According the Board of Health citation there was a complaint
of a “odorous black smoke” being emitted from the greenhouses in 1986. The representative
from the Board of Health indicated that the Green Thumb Nursery used coal to heat their
greenhouses at one time.

4.3 SUMMARY OF SITE AND AREA HISTORY

4.3.1 Site History

Parcel 13:

This portion of the Site has been used as a nursery since the 1950’s and was occupied by a
commercial building, a garage utilized for maintenance, four greenhouses, and several building
utilized for storage. Prior to Parcel 13 being utilized as a nursery, the property was in use as
agricultural land.

Parcel 13A:

Parcel 13A was formerly occupied by a single family home, reportedly constructed in 1953. The
wood frame structure was removed from the property in June 2009, at this time the concrete
foundation remains. According to records at the Westborough Building Department the septic
system and 2,000-gallon heating oil UST were removed from the property at the time of the
demolition. Prior to Parcel 13A being occupied by the single family residence, the property was
in use as agricultural land.

7.0 SITE RECONNAISSANCE

Mr. Eric Kaatz of ECS conducted a site visit on January 15, 2010. The majority of the property was
vacant and the residential dwelling and greenhouses associated with the Green Thumb Nursery were
demolished in 2009. At the time of the site visit the ground was by snow covered. There was a two-bay
garage and storage shed still located on the northeastern portion of Parcel 13. At the time of the Site visit
there were two plow trucks owned by Brendon Properties located in this building. ECS was not provided
access to the interior of the building at the time of the inspection. On February 16, 2010, during the sub-
surface investigation, ECS was provided access to the interior of the building by an employee of Brendon
Properties. According this employee the building is not heated and there is no water supply to the
building. Upon entering the building, ECS observed that the building was primarily used for vehicle
storage.

7.1.1 Hazardous Materials Use and Storage

No hazardous waste storage area was observed. The garage which houses the plow trucks for
Brendon properties could not be accessed at the time of the site walk. It could not be determined
if there were hazardous materials stored in this building. Based on a telephone interview with
Mr. Hight, as discussed in section 4.1.3 of this report, he had no knowledge of hazardous
materials stored at the facility.

7.1.2 Petroleum Use and Storage

As discussed in Section 3.1, heating oil and waste oil was formerly stored on Parcel 13 in a
10,000-gallon and heating oil was stored on Parcel 13A in a 2,000-gallon UST. These USTs
were removed from the properties in 2006 and 2009, according to permits found in the
Westborough Building Department files for the Site.

Fire Department records indicated the presence or former presence of a 200-gallon gasoline UST
and a 4,000 gallon UST. Building department records included disposal receipts for 1,000 gallon
and 5,000 gallon USTs dated October 2001, indicating that other USTs may have historically
been present on the property; however, no other records or information was found regarding the
location or contents related of these USTs.



Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Project No. 05-213212.00
Commercial Property
183 Turnpike Road March 2010
Westborough, Massachusetts Page 17

Based on a telephone conversation with Mr. Allen Hight, ECS was informed that Brendon
Properties does not store petroleum based materials in containers larger than five-gallons in their
garage.

Observations during the site walk did not reveal evidence of any vent pipes, ASTs, USTs or
indications that petroleum products were stored in bulk at the site.

7.1.3 Hazardous Waste Generation and Disposal

There is no evidence of hazardous waste generation or disposal at the property.

7.2 FLOOR DRAINS, SUMPS, PITS AND LAGOONS

Mr. Allen Hight informed ECS, to the best of his knowledge there are not any floor drains in the garage
building located on Parcel 13, ECS was not provided access to the building at the time of the site
inspection to confirm this.

All other buildings have been demolished leaving only the concrete foundations in place. During the Site
walk the site was covered with snow, therefore the concrete slabs could not be observed for signs of floor
drains. However on March 3, 2010, ECS returned to the site when it was free of snow and inspected the
concrete slabs. Based on these observations perforations in the floors of these foundations, which would
be indicative of floor drains, were not observed.

7.3 ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMERS AND PCB RELATED EQUIPMENT

One pole mounted transformer was observed on the western side of Woodman Avenue in the vicinity of
the driveway to the residential dwelling at the 183 Turnpike property. No labels indicating the presence
of PCBs were observed. There appeared to be staining down the sides of the transformer; however, no
staining was observed on the ground in the vicinity of the pole.

7.4 SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL

There are no dumpsters located on the property.

Located at the northeastern portion of Parcel 13 there are several stock piles of soil. The origin of this
material is unknown and could not be determined.

According to Mr. Hight the property was logged during the demolition activities in 2009, Logs and other
logging debris was left on the property. The debris is located at the northwestern corner of Parcel 13A.

7.5 STAINED SURFACES AND DISTRESSED VEGETATION

No distressed vegetation or stained surfaces were observed on Site, however based on snow cover, ECS
could not observe the ground surface throughout the entire Site.

8.0 SUBSURFACE INVESTIGATION

Based on the finding of the ASTM Phase I conducted for the site, ECS recommended further inquiry into
the following areas on the two parcels as summarized below.

Former 10,000-gallon fuel oil UST area: The former 10,000 gallon fuel oil UST was removed from
Parcel 13 on July 18, 2006. The fuel oil UST was reportedly also utilized to store waste oil as 2,400
gallons of waste oil was pumped out of the UST on May 5, 2006. At the time of UST removal three grab
soil samples were collected and submitted for EPH analysis and one composite sample was submitted for
RCRA 8 and PCB analysis. No reportable concentrations of target analytes were detected. As waste oil
was reported to have been stored in this UST, ECS recommended this area be assessed for the presence of
VOCs as the source of the waste oil is unknown.

Pesticide rinse water area: Pesticides have been used on the property in association with nursery
operations. In addition, according to the ASTM Phase I the disposal of pesticide container rinse waters
was conducted on the ground at the property located immediately adjacent to and inferred upgradient of
Parcel 13. ECS recommended investigating the upgradient portions of the property, the leach field area
and the collection of soil samples in the vicinity of the former greenhouses for pesticides, lead and
arsenic.

Garage and Loading Dock Area: Parcel 13 contains a garage historically used for equipment maintenance
and storage. According to various reports on the property debris including an old abandoned generator
have been reported to be historically located in various areas of Parcel 13.

Former 2,000-gallon fuel oil UST and septic tank area: Located to the north of the former residential
dwelling on Parcel 13A, there was a 2,000 gallon fuel oil UST and a concrete septic tank. Though the
UST removal records were available at the fire department, there was no indication of an investigation to
evaluate environmental conditions in the vicinity of the former UST and septic tank. ECS recommended
investigating the area in the vicinity of these structures and collection of soil samples for VPH and EPH.

A Zone II boundary is located within 500’ and almost immediately adjacent to the northeast corner of the
Parcels, and the Parcels are located within a Town of Westborough Zone III aquifer protection district.
Therefore the site subject to MCP RCS-1 and RCGW-1 soil and groundwater reportable concentrations.

Based on an evaluation of the identified RECs ECS recommended the following ASTM Phase II activities
be completed:

 Advancing one boring/well in the vicinity of the former waste oil UST and former storage area
and collecting soil and groundwater samples which will be assessed for volatile petroleum
hydrocarbons (VPH) and EPH, RCRA 8 metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides,
arsenic, lead, and VOCs in soil;

 Advancing up two borings in the vicinity of the reported pesticide rinse water area and septic
tank, and collecting soil samples which will be assessed for pesticides, arsenic, and lead in soil;

 Advancing one boring/well in the garage and loading dock area to establish a baseline of the soil
and groundwater conditions proximal to these two existing potential sources. Groundwater and
soil samples from the borings/wells will be evaluated for petroleum related compounds,
pesticides, arsenic, and lead; and



Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Project No. 05-213212.00
Commercial Property
183 Turnpike Road March 2010
Westborough, Massachusetts Page 19

 Advancing one boring/well in the vicinity former 2,000-gallon fuel oil UST and septic tank area
associated with the residential dwelling located on Parcel 13A to establish a baseline of the soil
and groundwater conditions proximal to these two existing potential sources.

 Advancing eighteen shallow boring throughout the site in order to delineate elevated arsenic
concentrations.

As part of this Phase II ESA, ECS performed a limited subsurface investigation for the purpose of
evaluating the soil and groundwater at the Site. Sections 8.0 and 9.0 of this report are associated with the
February and March 2010 subsurface investigation.

Select soil and groundwater samples were submitted to Spectrum Analytical of Agawam, Massachusetts for
laboratory analysis. The soil boring and monitoring well locations are indicated on Figure 2 (Site Plan).
The results of the laboratory analyses are discussed in the following report section.

8.1 SOIL BORING ADVANCEMENT & INSTALLATION OF GROUNDWATER MONITORING WELLS

On February 2, 2010 and February 16, 2010, ECS personnel supervised the advancement of four soil
borings at the Site in the locations depicted on Figure 2 (Site Plan). Soil borings B-1, B-2, B-3, and B-4
were advanced by Drilex Environmental of West Boylston, Massachusetts, using a truck-mounted hollow
stem auger drill rig. Soil boring B-1 and B-4 were constructed as groundwater monitoring wells.

 Boring B-1/MW-2 was advanced in the vicinity of the former 10,000-gallon fuel oil UST and
former storage area to characterized for the presence of VPH, EPH, RCRA 8 metals, PCBs,
pesticides, lead, arsenic, and VOCs in soil and groundwater;

 Boring B-2 was advanced in the vicinity pesticide container rinse water dumping, to characterized
for the presence of pesticides, lead, and arsenic in soil;

 Boring B-3 was advanced in the vicinity of the former 2,000-gallon fuel oil UST and septic tank
area associated with the residential dwelling located on Parcel 13A, to characterized for the
presence of VPH and EPH in soil;

 Boring B-4/MW-1 was advanced in the vicinity of the garage and loading dock area, to
characterized for the presence of VPH, EPH, pesticides, lead, arsenic, and volatile organic
compounds in soil and groundwater; and

 ECS collected surficial soil samples (HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, and HA-4) using a hand auger from
various locations across Parcel 13, to characterized for the presence of pesticides, lead, and
arsenic in soil.

The monitoring wells (MW-1 and MW-2) were constructed of schedule 40, 0.01 inch slot PVC well screen
attached with flush-threaded joints to solid PVC riser pipe. A bentonite seal was placed above the screened
portion of the wells. The boring annulus surrounding the screened interval was packed with clean No. 2 grade
Jersey sand or equivalent to a depth of one foot above the screened interval in the well, which was capped by
a bentonite plug. Grout was used to fill the boring annulus to the surface where a flush curb box protective
casing was cemented in place. Groundwater was encountered in boring B-1/MW-2 at a depth of 19.0 feet
below grade (fbg) and B-4 at a depth of 13.5 feet below grade.

Based on the detection of pesticides and arsenic in shallow soils (discussed in Section 9.0 below), ECS
returned to the Site on March 3, 2010 at the request of the Warren Equities to conduct additional subsurface
investigation activities consisting of the advancement of 18 soil borings to depths ranging from 4-8 fbg and
the collection an analysis of soil samples.



Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Project No. 05-213212.00

183 Turnpike Road March 2010
Westborough, Massachusetts Page 20

On March 3, 2010, ECS personnel supervised the advancement of eighteen shallow soil borings at the site
in the locations depicted on Figure 2 (Site Plan). Soil borings GP-1 through GP-18 were advanced by
Bronson Drilling of Lexington, Massachusetts, using a track-mounted power probe direct push drill rig.

The eighteen shallow soil borings were advanced to a depth of four fbg, with the exception of GP-3 and
GP-17 which were advanced to a depth of 8 fbg.

Further details about the individual borings and wells can be found in the Boring Logs, which are
included in Appendix H.

8.2 SOIL SAMPLING

On February 2 and February 16, 2010, soil borings were advanced with the use of a hollow stem auger
drill rig and soil samples were collected by a decontaminated, stainless steel, split-spoon sampler. Soil
samples were collected at two or five foot intervals based on field screening results and the depth of the
water table interface. The soil samples from HA-1 through HA-4 were collected by a decontaminated,
stainless steel, hand auger. Soil sampling equipment was scrubbed in an Alconox solution and rinsed in
deionized water between uses.

Eighteen soil borings were advanced on March 3, 2010 with the use of direct push technology. Soil
samples were collected continuously from each soil boring using a 4-foot long 1.5-inch inside diameter
macro-core sampler beginning at surface grade to the boring termination depth.

8.3 CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBSURFACE SOILS

The soils encountered at the site consist of fine to medium sand and gravel to a depth of 7.0 fbg to 11.5
fbg in Borings B-1 and B-4, respectively. Boring B-1 is located in the vicinity of the former 10,000-
gallon UST, located in the southwestern corner of Parcel 13. Boring B-4 is located in the vicinity of the
former of the garage and loading dock area, located at the northeastern portion of Parcel 13A. During the
advancement of Boring B-1, below the fine to medium sand and gravel, the material encountered
consisted nested boulders with sand and gravel. Apparent bedrock was not encountered during the
advancement of boring B-1.

Bedrock was encountered at the boring B-4 location at a depth of 7.0 fbg. Drilex Environmental
advanced the boring sequent to auger refusal with an air hammer to a depth of 25 fbg.

8.4 FIELD SCREENING & LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF SOIL AND GROUNDWATER SAMPLES

Soil samples were visually characterized, logged, and examined for abnormalities indicative of
contamination as would be evidenced by an unusual odor, texture, or color. Representative portions of each
soil sample were collected in 8-ounce glass jars with an aluminum-foil seal placed beneath the screw cap,
and field screened for the presence of TOVs with a portable PID calibrated to a benzene response factor.

No TOVs were detected in the soil samples collected from borings B-2, B-3, B-4, GP-1, GP-2, GP-3, GP-
4, GP-5, GP-6, GP-7, GP-8, GP-9, GP-10, GP-11, GP-12, GP-13, GP-14, GP-15, GP-16, GP-17, or GP-
18. A PID reading of 4.8 ppm was detected in the soil sample collected from a depth of 10 to 12 fbg in
boring B-1/MW-2. All other PID readings in boring B-1/MW-2 were below detection limits. Headspace
screening results for each soil sample are presented in the Boring Logs, included as Appendix H.

9.0 LABORATORY ANALYTICAL RESULTS

This section summarizes the analytical results from the February 2, 2010 and March 3, 2010 subsurface
investigations and the groundwater analytical results from the February 22, 2010 groundwater sampling
event. Soil and groundwater samples from the Site were submitted to Spectrum Analytical of Agawam,
Massachusetts, for laboratory analysis. The analyses performed on each sample were chosen based on the
potential RECs observed within close proximity to the sampling locations. The analytical reports are
included in their entirety as Appendix I.

9.1 SOIL SAMPLING & ANALYTICAL RESULTS

Soil samples were selected for analyses based on potential contaminant sources, PID screening and
location within the saturated zone. Following the February 2, 2010 and March 3, 2003 subsurface
investigations, select soil samples were submitted for laboratory analysis. The samples from B-1 (10’-
12’), B-3 (5’-7’), and B-4 (5’-7’) were submitted for analysis of VPH and EPH. The samples from B-1
(10’-12’), and B-4 (5’-7’) were submitted for analysis of VOCs by EPA method 8260. The soil sample
from B-1 (10’-12’) was submitted for analysis of PCB’s and RCRA 8 Metals. The soil samples from B-1
(10’-12’), B-2 (0.5’-2.5’), B-2 (1’-3’), B-4 (0.5’-2.5’), B-4 (1’-3’), HA-1 (0.5’-1’), HA-2 (0.5’-1’), HA-3
(0.5’-1’), and HA-4 (0.5’-1’) were submitted for arsenic, pesticides, and lead. The soil samples collected
from GP-2 (0’-1’), GP-3 (2’-4’), GP-5 (0’-1’), GP-6 (0’-1’), GP-7 (2’-4’), and GP-12 (0’-1’) were
submitted for pesticides and arsenic. The soil samples collected from GP-17 (0’-1’), GP-17 (2’-4’), and
GP-17 (4’-6’) were submitted for arsenic and chromium analysis. The remaining shallow soil samples
collected from the 0 to 1 ft and/or 2 to 4 ft intervals at locations GP-1 through GP-16 were submitted for
arsenic analysis only.

No VPH concentrations were detected above their applicable MCP RCS-1 Reportable Concentrations.

No VOCs, PCBs, or EPH were detected at concentrations above laboratory detection limits.

Arsenic and lead concentrations were detected in the samples collected from the boring B-1, B-2, B-3, B-
4, HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, and HA-4 at concentration above laboratory detection limits. Arsenic was
detected at concentrations exceeding the applicable RCS-1 reportable concentrations in the soil samples
from B-4 (0.5’-1’), HA-2 (0.5’-1’), HA-3 (0.5’-1’), GP-2 (0’-1’), GP-4 (0’-1’), GP-6 (0’-1’), GP-6 (2’-
4’), GP-7 (2’-4’), GP-9 (0’-1’), GP-14 (0’-1’), GP-17 (0’-1’), GP-18 (0’-1’), and GP-18 (2’-4’).
Chromium was detected above the RCS-1 reportable concentration in the soil sample collected from the
boring B-1 at the 10’-12’ interval. It should be noted that arsenic concentrations were detected in soil
samples HA-2, GP-6, and GP-18 at concentrations of 40.1 mg/Kg, 105 mg/Kg, and 51.5 mg/Kg,
respectively. These samples were each collected from a depth of less than one foot below grade. These
concentrations could pose an Imminent Hazard in accordance with the provisions of the MCP 310 CMR
40.0321(2) (b), and constitute a two hour Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
(MassDEP) release notification obligation.

Organochlorine pesticide constituents were detected above the laboratory detection limits in the HA-2,
HA-3, HA-4, GP-2, and GP-6 shallow soil samples, which were collected at depths of less than one-foot
below grade (fbg). The compound Endosulfan sulfate exceeded the RCS-1 reportable concentration of
500 ug/l, in the HA-2 (0.5’-1’) sample with a concentration of 566 ug/l. No other compounds were
found to exceed the RCS-1 standards.

Soil analytical results are summarized in Tables 1 through 6 and laboratory certificates are included as
Appendix I.

9.2 GROUNDWATER SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL

On February 22, 2010, ECS collected groundwater samples from the newly installed wells, MW-1 and
MW-2. Groundwater samples were collected from select monitoring wells via low flow sampling
techniques. Prior to sampling, the depth to groundwater was measured in each monitoring well using an
electronic water level indicator. Depths to water ranged from 13.31 fbg to 17.13 fbg in monitoring wells
MW-1 and MW-2, respectively. Light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) was not detected in either
monitoring well. During groundwater sampling events, groundwater geochemical parameters (specific
conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature and oxidation reduction potential (ORP)) were
measured using a YSI Model 600 XL probe from select monitoring wells.

Groundwater samples collected from MW-1 and MW-2 were submitted for VPH, EPH, pesticides,
dissolved arsenic and dissolved lead. No concentrations of these analytes were detected at concentrations
above laboratory detection limits in the groundwater samples collected from these monitoring wells.

The groundwater sample collected from MW-2 was also analyzed for VOCs and dissolved chromium.
Dissolved chromium was not detected above the laboratory detection limits. The compound sec-
butylbenzene was detected at a concentration of 1.6 1 micrograms per liter (ug/l), there is no RCGW-1
reportable concentration for this compound.

The VPH, EPH, VOCs, pesticides, dissolved arsenic, lead and chromium results are summarized in
Tables 7 through 11. The groundwater laboratory certificates are included as Appendix I.

10.0 FINDINGS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONAL OPINION

10.1 ENVIRONMENTAL SITE CONDITION FINDINGS

The following known or suspect environmental conditions were identified during this Phase I ESA:

 The historic presence of USTs at the site; and,

 The historic use and reported disposal of pesticides at the site.

10.2 DATA GAPS AND OPINION

Data gaps as defined by ASTM E 1527-05 are considered to arise from a lack of or inability to obtain
information required by this ASTM Standard Practice. Examples of ASTM related data gaps include the
inability to conduct site reconnaissance due to access restrictions (i.e. locked doors, snow cover, inability
to gain access to site), inability to conduct interviews with key site personnel or officials, or gaps in site
history (i.e. missing Historical Street Directory volumes, Sanborn Maps, aerial photographs, etc.). An
Opinion concerning the significance of data gaps and whether the absence of related information
adversely affects the Environmental Professional’s (EP) ability to determine if recognized environmental
conditions exist at the site is provided below.

The following data gaps were identified and are discussed:

 The unknown location of the septic tank for Parcel 13. The location of the septic manhole cover
was noted on site plan produced and provided to ECS, by Waterman Design Associates, Inc.,
however the location of this manhole cover could not be located in the field. ECS advanced one
boring (B-2) to a depth of 9.5 fbg, in order to address the subsurface conditions in the vicinity of
the septic tank.

 Absence of sufficient historical information related to the presence of historical USTs. Building
Department records indicate that the two Steel USTs were properly disposed of in October 2001.
Based on municipal file reviews, previous environmental reports, and interviews with the current
property owner, there is no indication of the former locations of these USTs. Based the disposal
receipts, ECS determined that the USTs have been removed from the site and properly disposed
of at Tombarello & Sons disposal yard. ECS conducted a subsurface investigation in March
2010, based on the findings of this investigation; no indications of a release of petroleum based
products were identified in the soil or groundwater samples.

 Sanborn Maps do not provide coverage of the site and surrounding area. This is not considered to
be a significant data gap.

10.3 RATIONALE FOR IDENTIFICATION OF RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

In accordance with the All Appropriate Inquiry Final Rule (40 CFR Part 312) and further detailed in
Section 12.6 of ASTM 1527-05, the opinion summarized below concerning the presence of recognized
environmental conditions identified during the site assessment is provided by the EP supervising this
assessment. The opinion has considered the usefulness and completeness of information obtained during



Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Project No. 05-213212.00
Commercial Property
183 Turnpike Road March 2010
Westborough, Massachusetts Page 24

the course of the assessment, whether or not data gaps identified in Section 10.2 adversely affect the
ability of the EP to provide an opinion.

It is the opinion of the EP for this assessment that recognized environmental conditions do exist at the
site. The rationale used in considering whether a given site condition is or is not currently a recognized
environmental condition is discussed below.

Historical/Former USTs: USTs have been historically located on the property. Assessment activities
conducted in the vicinity of the former 10,000 gallon fuel oil/waste oil indicated the presence of
chromium in soil at a concentration exceeding the RCS-1 reportable concentration. No other VPH, EPH,
VOCs, metals, or PCBs were detected in soil or groundwater exceeding applicable RCs. Assessment
activities conducted in the vicinity of the former 2,000 gallon fuel oil UST indicated no VPH or EPH
constituents were detected above applicable RCs in soil or groundwater. However, Town of
Westborough Fire Department and Building Department records indicate that other USTs may have been
historically present at the site. Additional details regarding the removal, capacity, location, or contents of
these USTs were not located.

Historical Pesticide Usage: Pesticides have been used on the property in association with nursery
operations. According to previous reports the disposal of pesticide container rinse waters was conducted
on the ground at the property located immediately adjacent to and inferred upgradient of Parcel 13.
Subsurface investigations conducted in February and March 2010 have identified the presence of
pesticides at concentrations exceeding applicable RCs in one soil sample, and the presence of arsenic at
concentrations exceeding the applicable RCs in 13 soil samples. Additionally, the presence of arsenic in
soil at depths of less than 12 inches below grade and at concentrations exceeding 40 mg/Kg is indicative
that an Imminent Hazard may be present in accordance with the provisions of the MCP and constitutes a
two hour MassDEP notification obligation and the need to conduct Immediate Response Actions.
Impacted areas include the vicinity of the former greenhouse and the vicinity of the existing garage.

11.0 CONCULSIONS

ECS has completed a combined Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessment of former Green
Thumb Nursery, located at 183 and 185 Turnpike Road in Westborough, Massachusetts. The assessment
was performed in accordance with ASTM Standard Practice E 1527-05. There were no exceptions or
deletions from this practice.

ECS completed Phase I ESA investigations for the site in February 2010, and documented the following
information about the Site:

 Former 10,000-gallon fuel oil UST area: The former 10,000 gallon fuel oil UST was removed
from Parcel 13 on July 18, 2006. The fuel oil UST was reportedly also utilized to store waste oil
as 2,400 gallons of waste oil was pumped out of the UST on May 5, 2006. At the time of UST
removal three grab soil samples were collected and submitted for EPH analysis and one
composite sample was submitted for RCRA 8 and PCB analysis. No reportable concentrations of
target analytes were detected. As waste oil was reported to have been stored in this UST, ECS
recommended this area be assessed for the presence of VOCs as the source of the waste oil is
unknown.

 Pesticide rinse water area: Pesticides have been used on the property in association with nursery
operations. In addition, according to the ASTM Phase I the disposal of pesticide container rinse
waters was conducted on the ground at the property located immediately adjacent to and inferred
upgradient of Parcel 13. ECS recommended investigating the upgradient portions of the property,
the leach field area and the collection of soil samples in the vicinity of the former greenhouses for
pesticides, lead and arsenic.

 Garage and Loading Dock Area: Parcel 13 contains a garage historically used for equipment
maintenance and storage. Various debris including an old abandoned generator has been reported
to be historically located in various areas of Parcel 13.

 Former 2,000-gallon fuel oil UST and septic tank area: Located to the north of the former
residential dwelling on Parcel 13A, there was a 2,000 gallon fuel oil UST and a concrete septic
tank. Though the UST removal records were available at the fire department, there was no
indication of an investigation to evaluate environmental conditions in the vicinity of the former
UST and septic tank. ECS recommended investigating the area in the vicinity of these structures
and collection of soil samples for VPH and EPH.

Based on the above findings, ECS recommended subsurface investigation activities, which were
completed in February and March 2010. The subsurface investigations identified the following:

 The presence of chromium in one soil sample collected from the former fuel oil/waste oil UST
area at concentrations exceeding the applicable RCS-1 reportable concentration;

 The presence of pesticides in soil samples collected from five shallow soil borings, one of which
exhibited concentrations exceeding applicable RCs;

 The presence of arsenic in 13 soil samples at concentrations exceeding the applicable RC;
 The presence of arsenic in three soil samples collected from the top 12 inches of soil at

concentrations greater than 40 mg/Kg, indicating the potential presence of an Imminent Hazard;



Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Project No. 05-213212.00
Commercial Property
183 Turnpike Road March 2010
Westborough, Massachusetts Page 26

 No VPH, EPH, VOC, or PCBs were detected in soil samples at concentrations exceeding
applicable RCs; and

 No VPH, EPH, VOC, metals, or pesticides were detected in groundwater at concentrations
exceeding applicable RCs.

Based on the findings of this ESA investigation, RECs were identified at the site, as indicated above.
ECS recommends MassDEP notification of the conditions outlined above in accordance with the
requirements of the MCP.

The chromium and pesticides concentrations detected in soil above the RCs constitute a 120 day
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) release notification obligation.

The arsenic concentrations could pose an Imminent Hazard in accordance with the provisions of the MCP
310 CMR 40.0321(2)(b), and constitute a two hour Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection (MassDEP) release notification obligation.

Additional assessment and/or remedial activities will be warranted under the direction of a Licensed Site
Professional (LSP) in order to address the release(s) of chromium, arsenic, and pesticides.

Notice of Disclaimer

Due  to the  limitations,  constraints,  inaccuracies and  incompleteness  of  government  information  and computer mapping data  currently  available to FirstSearch
Technology Corp., certain conventions  have been utilized in preparing  the locations of all  federal,  state and local agency sites residing in FirstSearch Technology
Corp.'s databases. All EPA NPL and state landfill sites are  depicted by a rectangle approximating their location and size. The boundaries of the rectangles represent
the eastern and western most longitudes; the  northern and  southern most latitudes. As such, the  mapped areas may exceed  the actual areas and do not represent the
actual boundaries of these properties. All other sites are  depicted by a point  representing their  approximate address location and  make no  attempt to represent the
actual areas of the associated property. Actual boundaries and locations of individual properties can be found in the files residing at the agency responsible for such
information.

Waiver of Liability

Although FirstSearch Technology Corp. uses  its best efforts to research the actual location of each site, FirstSearch Technology Corp. does not and can not warrant
the  accuracy of these  sites with  regard to  exact location and  size. All  authorized  users of FirstSearch Technology Corp.'s services  proceeding are signifying an
understanding of FirstSearch Technology Corp.'s  searching and  mapping  conventions, and  agree to waive any and all liability claims  associated  with search and
map results showing incomplete and or inaccurate site locations.

I attest that the information contained within the report has been reviewed for accuracy and checked against the quality control 

requirements for each method.  These results relate only to the sample(s) as received.  

All applicable NELAC requirements have been met.

Spectrum Analytical holds certification in the State of Massachusetts for the analytes as indicated with an X in the "Cert." column 

within this report.  Please note that the State of Massachusetts does not offer certification for all analytes.

Please note that this report contains 62 pages of analytical data plus Chain of Custody document(s).  When the Laboratory Report is 

indicated as revised, this report supercedes any previously dated reports for the laboratory ID(s) referenced above.  Where this report 

identifies subcontracted analyses, copies of the subcontractor's test report is available upon request.  This report may not be 

reproduced, except in full, without written approval from Spectrum Analytical, Inc.

Spectrum Analytical, Inc. is a NELAC accredited laboratory organization and meets NELAC testing standards. Use of the NELAC logo however 

does not insure that Spectrum is currently accredited for the specific method or analyte indicated. Please refer to our "Quality" web page at 

www.spectrum-analytical.com for a full listing of our current certifications and fields of accreditation. States in which Spectrum Analytical, Inc. 

holds NELAC certification are New York, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Florida. All analytical work for Volatile Organic and Air analysis are

CASE NARRATIVE:

The sample temperature upon receipt by Spectrum Analytical courier was recorded as 3.6 degrees Celsius.  The condition of these 

samples was further noted as refrigerated.  The samples were transported on ice to the laboratory facility and the temperature was 

recorded at 3.0 degrees Celsius upon receipt at the laboratory.  Please refer to the Chain of Custody for details specific to sample 

receipt times.

An infrared thermometer with a tolerance of +/- 2.0 degrees Celsius was used immediately upon receipt of the samples.

If a Matrix Spike (MS), Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) or Duplicate (DUP) was not requested on the Chain of Custody, method 

criteria may have been fulfilled with a source sample not of this Sample Delivery Group.

MADEP has published a list of analytical methods (CAM) which provides a series of recommended protocols for the acquisition, 

analysis and reporting of analytical data in support of MCP decisions.  "Presumptive Certainty" can be established only for those 

methods published by the MADEP in the MCP CAM.  The compounds and/or elements reported were specifically requested by the 

client on the Chain of Custody and in some cases may not include the full analyte list as defined in the method.      

According to WSC-CAM 5/2004 Rev.4, Table 11 A-1, recovery for some VOC analytes have been deemed potentially difficult. 

Although they may still be within the recommended 70%-130% recovery range, a range has been set based on historical control limits.

All VOC soils samples submitted and analyzed in methanol will have a minimum dilution factor of 50. This is the minimum amount of 

solvent allowed on the instrumentation without causing interference. Additional dilution factors may be required to keep analyte 

concentration within instrument calibration.

See below for any non-conformances and issues relating to quality control samples and/or sample analysis/matrix.

Notes and Definitions

Analyte quantified by quadratic equation type calibration.CAL1

Analyte percent drift/percent difference is greater than 30%, data is accepted due to all CCC analytes passing within the 

20% Drift/Difference criteria

CAL2

The concentration indicated for this analyte is an estimated value. This value is considered an estimate (CLP E-flag).E

The spike recovery was outside acceptance limits for the MS and/or MSD.  The batch was accepted based on acceptable 

LCS recovery.

QM7

The spike recovery for this QC sample is outside the established control limits. The sample results for the QC batch were 

accepted based on LCS/LCSD or SRM recoveries within the control limits.

QM9

The RPD result exceeded the QC control limits; however, both percent recoveries were acceptable. Sample results for the 

QC batch were accepted based on percent recoveries and completeness of QC data.

QR2

RPD out of acceptance range.QR5

The RPD exceeded the QC control limits; however precision is demonstrated with acceptable RPD values for MS/MSD.QR6

RPD Relative Percent Difference

dry Sample results reported on a dry weight basis

BRL Below Reporting Limit - Analyte NOT DETECTED at or above the reporting limit

Not ReportedNR

J Detected but below the Reporting Limit; therefore, result is an estimated concentration (CLP J-Flag).

A plus sign (+) in the Method Reference column indicates the method is not accredited by NELAC.

A Matrix Spike and Matrix Spike Duplicate (MS/MSD) for MADEP EPH CAM may not have been analyzed with the samples in 

this work order.  According to the method these spikes are performed only when requested by the client.  If requested the spike 

recoveries are included in the batch QC data.

Laboratory Control Sample (LCS):  A known matrix spiked with compound(s) representative of the target analytes, which is used to 

document laboratory performance.

Matrix Duplicate:  An intra-laboratory split sample which is used to document the precision of a method in a given sample matrix.

Matrix Spike:  An aliquot of a sample spiked with a known concentration of target analyte(s).   The spiking occurs prior to sample 

preparation and analysis.  A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.

Method Blank:  An analyte-free matrix to which all reagents are added in the same volumes or proportions as used in sample 

processing.  The method blank should be carried through the complete sample preparation and analytical procedure.  The method 

blank is used to document contamination resulting from the analytical process.

Method Detection Limit (MDL):  The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% 

confidence that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type 

containing the analyte.

Reportable Detection Limit (RDL):  The lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and 

accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions. For many analytes the RDL analyte concentration is selected as the lowest 

non-zero standard in the calibration curve. While the RDL is approximately 5 to 10 times the MDL, the RDL for each sample takes 

into account the sample volume/weight, extract/digestate volume, cleanup procedures and, if applicable, dry weight correction. 

Sample RDLs are highly matrix-dependent.

Surrogate:   An organic compound which is similar to the target analyte(s) in chemical composition and behavior in the analytical 

process, but which is not normally found in environmental samples.  These compounds are spiked into all blanks, standards, and 

samples prior to analysis.  Percent recoveries are calculated for each surrogate.

CASE NARRATIVE:

The sample temperature upon receipt by Spectrum Analytical courier was recorded as 4.7 degrees Celsius.  The condition of these 

samples was further noted as received on ice.  The samples were transported on ice to the laboratory facility and the temperature was 

recorded at  degrees Celsius upon receipt at the laboratory.  Please refer to the Chain of Custody for details specific to sample receipt 

times.

An infrared thermometer with a tolerance of +/- 2.0 degrees Celsius was used immediately upon receipt of the samples.

If a Matrix Spike (MS), Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) or Duplicate (DUP) was not requested on the Chain of Custody, method 

criteria may have been fulfilled with a source sample not of this Sample Delivery Group.

MADEP has published a list of analytical methods (CAM) which provides a series of recommended protocols for the acquisition, 

analysis and reporting of analytical data in support of MCP decisions.  "Presumptive Certainty" can be established only for those 

methods published by the MADEP in the MCP CAM.  The compounds and/or elements reported were specifically requested by the 

client on the Chain of Custody and in some cases may not include the full analyte list as defined in the method.      

According to WSC-CAM 5/2009 Rev.1, Table 11 A-1, recovery for some VOC analytes have been deemed potentially difficult. 

Although they may still be within the recommended recovery range, a range has been set based on historical control limits.

See below for any non-conformances and issues relating to quality control samples and/or sample analysis/matrix.

Notes and Definitions

The analyte result for the confirmation column was outside of the acceptance limits.  The result from the primary column 

was used. The analyte was not detected in the associated samples.

DC1

The RPD result exceeded the QC control limits; however, both percent recoveries were acceptable. Sample results for the 

QC batch were accepted based on percent recoveries and completeness of QC data.

QR2

dry Sample results reported on a dry weight basis

BRL Below Reporting Limit - Analyte NOT DETECTED at or above the reporting limit

Not ReportedNR

A plus sign (+) in the Method Reference column indicates the method is not accredited by NELAC.

Laboratory Control Sample (LCS):  A known matrix spiked with compound(s) representative of the target analytes, which is used to 

document laboratory performance.

Matrix Duplicate:  An intra-laboratory split sample which is used to document the precision of a method in a given sample matrix.

Matrix Spike:  An aliquot of a sample spiked with a known concentration of target analyte(s).   The spiking occurs prior to sample 

preparation and analysis.  A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.

Method Blank:  An analyte-free matrix to which all reagents are added in the same volumes or proportions as used in sample 

processing.  The method blank should be carried through the complete sample preparation and analytical procedure.  The method blank 

is used to document contamination resulting from the analytical process.

Method Detection Limit (MDL):  The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence 

that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type containing the 

analyte.

Reportable Detection Limit (RDL):  The lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and 

accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions. For many analytes the RDL analyte concentration is selected as the lowest 

non-zero standard in the calibration curve. While the RDL is approximately 5 to 10 times the MDL, the RDL for each sample takes 

into account the sample volume/weight, extract/digestate volume, cleanup procedures and, if applicable, dry weight correction. Sample 

RDLs are highly matrix-dependent.

Surrogate:   An organic compound which is similar to the target analyte(s) in chemical composition and behavior in the analytical 

process, but which is not normally found in environmental samples.  These compounds are spiked into all blanks, standards, and 

samples prior to analysis.  Percent recoveries are calculated for each surrogate.

CASE NARRATIVE:

The sample temperature upon receipt by Spectrum Analytical courier was recorded as 4.7 degrees Celsius.  The condition of these 

samples was further noted as refrigerated.  The samples were transported on ice to the laboratory facility and the temperature was 

recorded at 1.8 degrees Celsius upon receipt at the laboratory.  Please refer to the Chain of Custody for details specific to sample 

receipt times.

An infrared thermometer with a tolerance of +/- 2.0 degrees Celsius was used immediately upon receipt of the samples.

If a Matrix Spike (MS), Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) or Duplicate (DUP) was not requested on the Chain of Custody, method 

criteria may have been fulfilled with a source sample not of this Sample Delivery Group.

MADEP has published a list of analytical methods (CAM) which provides a series of recommended protocols for the acquisition, 

analysis and reporting of analytical data in support of MCP decisions.  "Presumptive Certainty" can be established only for those 

methods published by the MADEP in the MCP CAM.  The compounds and/or elements reported were specifically requested by the 

client on the Chain of Custody and in some cases may not include the full analyte list as defined in the method.      

According to WSC-CAM 5/2009 Rev.1, Table 11 A-1, recovery for some VOC analytes have been deemed potentially difficult. 

Although they may still be within the recommended recovery range, a range has been set based on historical control limits.

Some target analytes which are not listed as exceptions in the Summary of CAM Reporting Limits may exceed the recommended RL 

based on sample initial volume or weight provided, % moisture content, or responsiveness of a particular analyte to purge and trap 

instrumentation.

Not ReportedNR

A plus sign (+) in the Method Reference column indicates the method is not accredited by NELAC.

Laboratory Control Sample (LCS):  A known matrix spiked with compound(s) representative of the target analytes, which is used to 

document laboratory performance.

Matrix Duplicate:  An intra-laboratory split sample which is used to document the precision of a method in a given sample matrix.

Matrix Spike:  An aliquot of a sample spiked with a known concentration of target analyte(s).   The spiking occurs prior to sample 

preparation and analysis.  A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.

Method Blank:  An analyte-free matrix to which all reagents are added in the same volumes or proportions as used in sample 

processing.  The method blank should be carried through the complete sample preparation and analytical procedure.  The method blank 

is used to document contamination resulting from the analytical process.

Method Detection Limit (MDL):  The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence 

that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type containing the 

analyte.

Reportable Detection Limit (RDL):  The lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and 

accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions. For many analytes the RDL analyte concentration is selected as the lowest 

non-zero standard in the calibration curve. While the RDL is approximately 5 to 10 times the MDL, the RDL for each sample takes 

into account the sample volume/weight, extract/digestate volume, cleanup procedures and, if applicable, dry weight correction. Sample 

RDLs are highly matrix-dependent.

Surrogate:   An organic compound which is similar to the target analyte(s) in chemical composition and behavior in the analytical 

process, but which is not normally found in environmental samples.  These compounds are spiked into all blanks, standards, and 

samples prior to analysis.  Percent recoveries are calculated for each surrogate.

Technical Reviewer's Initial:

I attest that the information contained within the report has been reviewed for accuracy and checked against the quality control 

requirements for each method.  These results relate only to the sample(s) as received.  

All applicable NELAC requirements have been met.

Spectrum Analytical holds certification in the State of Massachusetts for the analytes as indicated with an X in the "Cert." column 

within this report.  Please note that the State of Massachusetts does not offer certification for all analytes.

Please note that this report contains 34 pages of analytical data plus Chain of Custody document(s).  When the Laboratory Report is 

indicated as revised, this report supersedes any previously dated reports for the laboratory ID(s) referenced above.  Where this report 

identifies subcontracted analyses, copies of the subcontractor's test report are available upon request.  This report may not be 

reproduced, except in full, without written approval from Spectrum Analytical, Inc.

Spectrum Analytical, Inc. is a NELAC accredited laboratory organization and meets NELAC testing standards. Use of the NELAC logo however 

does not insure that Spectrum is currently accredited for the specific method or analyte indicated. Please refer to our "Quality" web page at 

www.spectrum-analytical.com for a full listing of our current certifications and fields of accreditation. States in which Spectrum Analytical, Inc. 

holds NELAC certification are New York, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Florida. All analytical work for Volatile Organic and Air analysis are

CASE NARRATIVE:

The sample temperature upon receipt by Spectrum Analytical courier was recorded as 2.6 degrees Celsius.  The condition of these 

samples was further noted as refrigerated.  The samples were transported on ice to the laboratory facility and the temperature was 

recorded at 3.8 degrees Celsius upon receipt at the laboratory.  Please refer to the Chain of Custody for details specific to sample 

receipt times.

An infrared thermometer with a tolerance of +/- 2.0 degrees Celsius was used immediately upon receipt of the samples.

If a Matrix Spike (MS), Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD) or Duplicate (DUP) was not requested on the Chain of Custody, method 

criteria may have been fulfilled with a source sample not of this Sample Delivery Group.

MADEP has published a list of analytical methods (CAM) which provides a series of recommended protocols for the acquisition, 

analysis and reporting of analytical data in support of MCP decisions.  "Presumptive Certainty" can be established only for those 

methods published by the MADEP in the MCP CAM.  The compounds and/or elements reported were specifically requested by the 

client on the Chain of Custody and in some cases may not include the full analyte list as defined in the method.      

According to WSC-CAM 5/2004 Rev.4, Table 11 A-1, recovery for some VOC analytes have been deemed potentially difficult. 

Although they may still be within the recommended 70%-130% recovery range, a range has been set based on historical control limits.

See below for any non-conformances and issues relating to quality control samples and/or sample analysis/matrix.

1,1,2-Trichlorotrifluoroethane (Freon 113) percent recoveries 137/130 (70-130) are outside individual acceptance criteria, but 

within overall method allowances.  All reported results of the following samples are considered to have a potentially high bias:

A Matrix Spike and Matrix Spike Duplicate (MS/MSD) for MADEP EPH CAM may not have been analyzed with the samples in 

this work order.  According to the method these spikes are performed only when requested by the client.  If requested the spike 

recoveries are included in the batch QC data.

Laboratory Control Sample (LCS):  A known matrix spiked with compound(s) representative of the target analytes, which is used to 

document laboratory performance.

Matrix Duplicate:  An intra-laboratory split sample which is used to document the precision of a method in a given sample matrix.

Matrix Spike:  An aliquot of a sample spiked with a known concentration of target analyte(s).   The spiking occurs prior to sample 

preparation and analysis.  A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.

Method Blank:  An analyte-free matrix to which all reagents are added in the same volumes or proportions as used in sample 

processing.  The method blank should be carried through the complete sample preparation and analytical procedure.  The method 

blank is used to document contamination resulting from the analytical process.

Method Detection Limit (MDL):  The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% 

confidence that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type 

containing the analyte.

Reportable Detection Limit (RDL):  The lowest concentration that can be reliably achieved within specified limits of precision and 

accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions. For many analytes the RDL analyte concentration is selected as the lowest 

non-zero standard in the calibration curve. While the RDL is approximately 5 to 10 times the MDL, the RDL for each sample takes 

into account the sample volume/weight, extract/digestate volume, cleanup procedures and, if applicable, dry weight correction. 

Sample RDLs are highly matrix-dependent.

Surrogate:   An organic compound which is similar to the target analyte(s) in chemical composition and behavior in the analytical 

process, but which is not normally found in environmental samples.  These compounds are spiked into all blanks, standards, and 

samples prior to analysis.  Percent recoveries are calculated for each surrogate.
