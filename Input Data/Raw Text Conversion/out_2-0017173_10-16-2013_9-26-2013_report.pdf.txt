1.0 Introduction 
 
Remediation & Environmental Management Services, Inc. (REMSERV, Inc.) has completed an IRA Status 
Report for the property located at 104 - 106 East Main Street, Milford, MA on behalf of the property owner.  
The IRA Status Report applies to Release Tracking Number (RTN) 2-17173, which the Massachusetts 
Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) assigned to a sudden release of diesel fuel from an 
underground storage tank (UST) located at the 104 - 106 East Main Street property.  The IRA Status Report 
discusses the recently completed IRA soil excavation activities at the site for the purpose of source removal.   
 
2.0 Site Description 
 
The site is located at the northeast corner of the junction of Route 16 and 85 in the Town of Milford, MA at 
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates 466932 mN and 292656 mE.  The property consists of an 
approximately 0.417 acre parcel of land identified by the Milford Assessor’s Office as Parcel ID 42-0-261 
(1).  The property was formerly operated as a petroleum dispensing station until retail operations were 
suspended on July 20, 2008 following the identification of the diesel release.  On July 23 and 24, 2008 
LaMountain Brothers of Oxford, MA (LaMountain) removed three (3) single wall fiberglass USTs (6,000-
gallon diesel, 8,000-gallon super unleaded gasoline, and 10,000-gallon regular unleaded gasoline) and the 
associated product piping from the site as part of Immediate Response Action (IRA) activities.  The 104 - 106 
East Main Street property has been inactive since July 20, 2008.   
 
The site is relatively flat at an elevation of approximately 285 feet above mean sea level according to the 
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (Figure 1).  The majority of the site was asphalt-paved prior to IRA 
activities associated with RTN 1-16282, with the exception of a landscaped island located in the southwest 
corner of the property.  A top layer of loosely consolidated backfill forms the current ground cover above the 
IRA excavation area described herein.  The portion of the site outside of the excavation area remains asphalt-
paved.   
 
The former station petroleum and concession sales building is located in the central area of the site.  A vacant 
single-story structure, formerly used for automobile repairs, is located in the north of the site and is currently 
utilized as a storage facility (Figure 2).  Two (2) former dispensing islands located in the southern portion of 
the site were removed as part of MassDEP approved Immediate Response Action (IRA) excavation activities.  
The petroleum dispensers were removed following the identification of the diesel release.   
 
The site is located approximately 60 to 80 feet south and crossgradient of a MassDEP approved Zone II for 
public drinking water supply protection for a public water production well located approximately 2,400 feet 
northwest of the site (Figure 1).  According to a May 28, 2004 “Class A-2 Response Action Outcome – 
Partial Statement / Class C Response Action Outcome Temporary Solution” produced by Delta 
Environmental Consultants, Inc. for the release associated with RTN 2-0854, there are no private drinking 
water wells located within 1,000 feet of the site (2). 
 
2.1 Abutting Property Usage 
 
The abutting property uses are noted as follows: 
 
North:  Residential properties; 
South:  East Main Street (Route 16) and assorted commercial use structures;   
East:  Cedar Street (Route 85) and a petroleum refueling station and automotive repair facility; and 
West: Residential properties.

2.2 Potential Human and Environmental Receptors 
 
The 104 - 106 East Main Street property is currently vacant, and therefore no employees of Route 16 Gas 
LLC use the property on a regular basis.  The only potential human receptors would be those individuals who 
are engaged in remediation activities at the site or individuals trespassing on the property. 
 
Based on population statistics for July 2008 produced by the US Census Bureau, REMSERV, Inc. estimates 
the population within one-half mile radius of the site to be 1,456 (3).  No institutions are located within a 500-
foot radius of the site (Figure 1).   
 
A potential environmental receptor, Cedar Swamp Pond, is located approximately 850 feet west of the site 
(Figure 1).  According to the Massachusetts “Surface Water Quality Standards” (314 CMR 4.00) (4), Cedar 
Swamp Pond is classified as a “Class B” surface water, meaning it is designated as a “a habitat for fish, other 
aquatic life, and wildlife, and for primary and secondary contact recreation and where designated they “shall 
be suitable as a source of public water supply with appropriate treatment” (4).  The site is not located within 
500 feet of state, federal, and private protected open space, Areas of Critical Environmental Concern, Species 
of Special Concern, Threatened or Endangered Species Habitat, Fish Habitats, or within 100 feet of wetlands, 
certified vernal pools, or outstanding resource waters (Figure 1). 
 
2.3 Site History 
 
Based on findings published in an IEP, Inc. Phase I Limited Site Investigation Report prepared for the 106 
East Main Street property on behalf of BP, REMSERV, Inc. has determined that the site was occupied by a 
residence “prior to World War II”.  The site was operated as an automotive refueling station from that time 
until August 28, 1961 when Gibbs Tire Depot, Inc purchased the property.  The buildings currently standing 
at the site were built about 1968 (1).  The property was purchased by British Petroleum (BP) on June 16, 
1981 and used primarily as a retail petroleum dispensing facility.  The property was then purchased by Gibbs 
Oil Company Limited Partnership on April 1, 1991 and utilized similarly.  On September 26, 2005, the 
property was purchased by its current owner, Route 16 Gas LLC. 
 
The site buildings have a history of previously being heated with No. 2 fuel oil.  Two fuel oil USTs located 
northeast of the sales kiosk, and one waste oil UST located west of the service garage, were removed in May 
and June, 1989.  There is no documented contamination in the IEP, Inc. report as contained in the Milford 
Fire Department records for the removal of the heating oil USTs or the waste oil UST. 
 
3.0 Site Geology 
 
A REMSERV, Inc. representative recorded soil conditions during the soil boring program conducted as part 
of MassDEP -approved IRA activities associated with RTN 2-17173.  The site soil types consist of fine to 
coarse sand, silt, and gravel.  Boring logs from REMSERV, Inc. subsurface exploration activities were 
previously provided in in the April 3, 2012 REMSERV, Inc. Phase II CSA Report.  . 
 
3.1 Bedrock Geology 
 
According to the Bedrock Map of Massachusetts, the bedrock geology beneath the site has been identified as 
part of the Milford-Dedham Zone (Tertiary and Older Rocks), specifically as part of the Blackstone Group 
(Undivided) described as quartzite, schist, phyllite, marble, and metavolcanic rocks.  The site is 
approximately 70 to 80 feet west of the contact with Milford Granite (Mafic phase) described as gray, seriate 
to sub-porphyritic granite to granodiorite, mafic minerals tend to be in clots; locally gneissic intrudes 
Blackstone Group (7).  Bedrock was not encountered during the REMSERV, Inc. subsurface investigation.

3.2 Hydrogeology 
 
On August 12, 2008 and July 14, 2009 REMSERV, Inc. conducted elevation surveys of monitoring wells 
installed at the 104 - 106 East Main Street property and at off-property locations to the north, west, and south 
(Figure 3).  Monitoring well elevations were used in conjunction with water table gauging values to estimate 
ground water flow across the site.  Using water table gauging values acquired during the April 19, 2013 event 
REMSERV, Inc. estimated ground water flow across the site trending in a south-southwesterly direction. 
 
On June 18, 2013 the depths to ground water ranged from 7.27 (MW-9) to 9.08 (GP101-MW) feet below 
ground surface.  Ground water elevations suggest an approximately southwestern ground water flow direction 
at an approximate hydraulic gradient of 0.0071 feet/feet (Figure 3). 
 
4.0 Release Description 
 
On July 20, 2008 at 11:15, a representative of Route 16 Gas LLC notified the MassDEP of a 2-Hour reporting 
condition when inventory discrepancies identified a release of diesel fuel from a 6,000-gallon UST.  On July 
20, 2008 Mr. Robert Dunne of the MassDEP Central Region Office (CERO) arrived on site to observe site 
conditions and to meet with representatives of Route 16 Gas, LLC.  Mr. Dunne delivered a field Notice of 
Responsibility for the sudden release of diesel fuel, which constituted a 2-hour reporting condition under 
MCP 310 CMR 40.0000.  The MassDEP subsequently assigned RTN 2-17173.  Inventory reconciliation 
identified an approximately 15,000 gallon discrepancy in diesel fuel records. 
 
Route 16 Gas, LLC currently owns and operated the station prior to the diesel release associated with RTN 2-
17173.   
 
4.1 Previous Releases 
 
A review of the MassDEP “Reportable Site Look Up” website identified two previously reported petroleum 
releases at the 104 - 106 East Main Street property (6). 
 
4.1.1 RTN 2-0854 
 
During activities associated with a Phase I Limited Site Investigation, Delta Environmental Consultants, Inc. 
(Delta) of Westford, MA identified dissolved volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds petroleum in 
ground water collected from on-site monitoring wells.  On March 13, 1991, the MassDEP was notified of the 
suspected release and release-tracking number (RTN) 2-0854 was assigned.  On September 23, 1991, a 
Notice of Responsibility (NOR) was issued to British Petroleum (BP), the owner and operator of the site.  
The site was tier classified as a Tier II site on March 23, 1992 
 
In 1997 BP Oil implemented a Release Abatement Measure (RAM) Plan to conduct soil vapor extraction and 
air sparging remediation activities in an attempt to reduce the gasoline impacts to soil and ground water at the 
site.  The remedial efforts focused on the areas along the western and southwestern areas (west and south of 
the former USTs and dispenser) where the gasoline release impacts were observed to be greatest.    
 
Early (1991 through 1995) ground water sampling and analyses consisted primarily of BTEX (benzene, 
toluene, ethylbenzene and total xylene) testing.  Benzene and total xylene concentrations were identified in 
MW-2 and MW-3 along the western property boundary, MW-4 along the southern property boundary and 
HydroPunch HP-1. HP-2 and HP-3 surrounding the former USTs exceeded the current MassDEP Method 1 
GW-2/GW-3 standards (Fugro Interim Phase II Comprehensive Site Assessment Report, September 1995). 
 
Similarly, 1993 soil sampling conducted by Fugro identified elevated BTEX compounds

On December 11, 2000, Delta submitted a Class A2 Response Action Outcome (RAO) Statement and a 
Release Abatement Measure (RAM) Completion Statement.  Periodic ground water monitoring continued as 
part of Post Class A2 RAO activities from December 2000 through May 2009.   
 
The “Additional Phase II Field Activities; Method 3 Risk Characterization: and the Phase III Selection of 
Comprehensive Remedial Response Action Alternatives Report” completed in October 2000 by Geologic 
Services Corporation contains tabulated soil results for the gasoline impacted soils in the northwest, west and 
southwest portions of the site.  The earlier soil analyses were only analyzed for BTEX as noted above.  Later 
soil analyses in August 2000 included VPH.  The soil samples collected from the west and southwest portions 
of the property that contained elevated readings from a photoionization detector (PID) included MW-1, (154 
ppmv), MW-2 (192 ppmv), MW-8 (150 ppmv), SB-5 (645 ppmv), SB-6 (326 ppmv), SB-8 (492 ppmv), SB-9 
(564 ppmv) and SB-10 (696 ppmv).  The italicized samples were analyzed.  If the sample IDs noted above 
are “bolded”, this indicates that this sample is the highest PID reading and was not submitted for lab analyses.  
In these cases, a sample with a significantly lower PID reading was analyzed.  The lower PID samples were 
typically collected from a higher elevation within the boring above the contaminated zone.   
 
4.1.2 RTN 2-15674 
 
On April 4, 2005, the MassDEP was notified of a two-hour reporting condition that resulted from a spill of 
approximately 70-75 gallons of gasoline as result of an overfill of an underground storage tank (UST) during 
a scheduled refilling event at the 106 East Main Street property.  The MassDEP issued release-tracking 
number (RTN) 2-15674 to J.P. Noonan Transportation, Inc. of West Bridgewater, MA. 
 
Following the spill, an undetermined volume of gasoline flowed into a downgradient catch basin.  Clean 
Harbors Environmental Services of Norwell, MA was called to the site and attempted to recover free 
petroleum from several downgradient catch basins.  At the orders of the Milford Fire Department, the catch 
basin was flushed at approximately 100 gallons per minute.  During flushing, a Clear Harbors vac truck 
recovered water with a petroleum sheen from a down gradient catch basin.  No separate phase petroleum was 
identified in any on-site monitoring wells and it was determined that there was no impact to site soils or 
ground water.  On December 5, 2005, Clean Harbors submitted a Class A1 RAO Statement with the 
MassDEP.   
 
5.0 Immediate Response Actions (IRA)  
 
On July 20, 2008 the MassDEP provided on-site oral IRA approval for the following activities: 
  
 Immediate removal of all diesel fuel from the leaking UST at the Site and recycle, reuse, or disposal of 

the diesel fuel off-site at a licensed facility; 
 Sample and gauge all monitoring wells that exist on the Site for the presence of diesel fuel and, if any is 

found in the wells, remove diesel fuel and water for proper disposal/recycling off-site at a licensed 
facility; 

 Remove the diesel fuel UST and up to 500 cubic yards of diesel fuel contaminated soil for proper 
disposal/recycling off-site at a licensed facility; 

 Monitor all nearby residences and other underground structures for the presence of diesel fuel or its 
volatile constituents; 

 Provide all UST records that document testing or inventory measurements of the contents of the diesel 
fuel UST; and 

 Install recovery sump wells on the Site to recover diesel fuel and water for proper disposal/recycling off-
site at a licensed facility.

On September 18, 2008, REMSERV, Inc. submitted an IRA Plan to the MassDEP detailing the above 
activities. 
 
REMSERV, Inc. received oral-approval for modifications to MassDEP -approved IRA activities including:  
 
 soil excavation volume increase to 1,000 yds³; and 
 Dewatering activities for the purpose of excavation below the water table.  
 
5.1 Historic IRA Activities 
 
In accordance with the September 18, 2008 IRA Plan, REMSERV, Inc. has conducted or overseen the 
following MassDEP -approved IRA activities associated with RTN 2-17173:   
 
 Removal of remainder of diesel fuel from the 6,000 gallon leaking UST; 
 Light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) gauging at site monitoring wells; 
 Recovery of approximately 15,295 gallons of free-phase petroleum from the site; 
 Utility vapor survey of all underground utilities in the vicinity of the site; 
 Indoor air quality assessment at the 3 Cedar Street and 112 East Main Street properties; 
 Removal of three (3) USTs (6,000 gallon diesel fuel UST, 8,000 gallon super unleaded gasoline UST and 

10,000 gallon regular unleaded gasoline UST); 
 Submittal of UST testing and inventory records for the diesel fuel UST;  
 2008 Excavation of petroleum-impacted soils; 
 2008 Transport of excavated soils to licensed asphalt-batch recycling facilities; 
 Installation of thirteen (13) temporary monitoring wells (RW-1 through RW-8, RW-Q, RW-A, RW-B, 

RW-C and RW-D) and three fixed-location recovery wells (RW-101, RW-102, RW-103); and 
 Soil and ground water chemical testing. 
 
5.1.1 Removal of Diesel from 6,000-Gallon Diesel UST 
 
On July 21, 2008 JP Noonan of West Bridgewater, MA pumped approximately 830 gallons of diesel fuel 
from the 6,000-gallon diesel UST and transported it for use at another petroleum dispensing station operated 
by the PRP. 
 
5.1.2 Monitoring Well Gauging  
 
On July 20, 2008 monitoring wells were gauged upon discovery of a release of diesel fuel at the property.  
The monitoring wells had been installed by a previous owner/operator during assessment of a gasoline release 
reported to the MassDEP in 1991, the assessment of which is continuing under a Class C Response Action 
Outcome (RAO).  The initial gauging identified the greatest volumes of LNAPL in MW-1, MW-2 and VE-5 
(Figure 2).   
 
REMSERV, Inc. utilized a Heron H.01L oil-water interface probe to gauge depth to ground water and to 
identify the presence of separate phase petroleum.  REMSERV, Inc. confirms the presence of product using a 
clear PVC bailer.  The results of post-excavation gauging events have been tabulated and summarized in 
Table 1.  REMSERV, Inc. currently gauges the following wells as part of IRA activities conducted since July 
21, 2008 (Figure 2):

The results of gauging events which have taken place between January 9, 2012 and October 11, 2012 have 
been discussed in the previous IRA Status Report Dated October 11, 2012, and they are summarized on Table 
1.  This report will discuss IRA activities which have taken place between October 12, 2012 and April 19, 
2013.  REMSERV, Inc. has gauged off property monitoring wells located on the west side of Route 85, south 
of Route 16, and on the 3 Cedar Street property to the north to assess the potential off-property migration of 
diesel fuel.  REMSERV, Inc. has not identified LNAPL at a detectable thickness in any of the off-property 
monitoring wells from October 12, 2012 and April 19, 2013.   
 
5.1.3 Separate Phase Petroleum Recovery 
 
The diesel recovery program consists of three methodologies.  The combined recovered volume of diesel fuel 
to date as a result of these three activities is approximately 15,295 gallons. 
 
Vac Truck Recovery  
 
From July 20 to August 13, 2008 diesel fuel was recovered from the monitoring wells and temporary 
recovery well locations by use of vacuum trucks supplied by TMC Services, Inc. of Bellingham, MA.  The 
greatest volumes were recovered initially following the release discovery using two vacuum trucks provided 
by TMC Services of Bellingham, MA.  The vacuum truck recovery efforts consisted of removing LNAPL 
from within the diesel UST by “vacuuming” the diesel product as it recharged through the hole at the base of 
the UST.  Following the UST removal, one of the vac trucks was assigned to recover diesel fuel from the 
excavation created by the removal of the 6,000 gallon diesel UST as well as two adjacent 10,000 gallon 
gasoline USTs.  The second vac truck was dedicated to diesel fuel recovery from the northern edge of the 
UST mat in MW-1 and along the western property boundary along Route 85 (Cedar Street) in VE-4 through 
6, MW-2, MW-3, GP105-MW, RW-1, and RW-3 through 5.   
 
From July 20 to August 13, 2008 the vac truck method recovered approximately 15,251 gallons of product.

Manual Gauging and Bailing 
 
Since July 20, 2008 REMSERV, Inc. staff, TMC and LaMountain field personnel, and a representative of 
Route 16 GAS LLC have gauged and hand bailed separate phase product from monitoring and recovery wells 
located at the site (Figure 2).  From July 21 to November 26, 2008 bailed petroleum was placed in on-site frac 
tanks.  On November 26, 2008 the on-site frac tanks were emptied of all remaining liquids by United 
Industrial Service of Stoughton, MA (United Industrial) vac trucks.  On December 5, 2008 the two on-site 
frac tanks were cleaned by United Industrial in preparation for removal from the site.  LaMountain removed 
the frac tanks on December16, 2008.  All petroleum recovered since the frac tank removal has been 
transported off-site for use in a waste-oil heater located at another petroleum dispensing station operated by 
the PRP.   
 
Passive Product Recovery Canisters 
 
On August 26, 2008 REMSERV, Inc. deployed five (5) Keck Passive Recovery Canisters (PRCs) in VE-4, 
MW-3, VE-5, GP105-MW, RW-4, VE-6 and/or RW-5 (Figure 2).  The PRCs have different reservoir 
volumes depending on the depths and screened length of the deployment locations.  The PRCs were checked 
for product weekly, emptied into the frac tank, and redeployed during the period between August 26, 2008 
and November 13, 2008.  The PRCs were removed from service from November 13, 2008 to December 16, 
2008 during additional soil excavation activities.   
 
On December 16, 2008 the PRCs were deployed in the newly installed recovery wells RW101, RW102, and 
RW103 (Figure 2).  REMSERV, Inc. has accessed and emptied the four deployed PRCs during gauging and 
recovery events conducted on December 16, 2008, January 14, February 12, April 16, May 12, June 9, and 
July 14, September 4, October 9, December 8, 2009. January 28, February 26, March 12, April, 14, May 13, 
July 2, August 9, October 18, October 20, November  2, 2010, January 11, March 14, April 15, July 21, 
November 2, 2011 and January 9, 2012 (Table 2).   
 
5.1.4 Monitoring Well Gauging Summary – October 12, 2012 to July 18, 2013 
 
REMSERV, Inc. has conducted five (5) ground water gauging events at the site during the reporting period 
between October 12, 2012 and July 18, 2013 (October 31, 2012, November 29, 2012, November 30, 2012, 
April 19, 2013 and July 18, 2013).  The ground water gauging results are summarized in Table 1.   
 
The ground water gauging events have identified measurable thicknesses of LNAPL in the following 
monitoring and/or recovery wells using the Heron interface probe.  The interface probe readings were verified 
using a product bailer when readers exceeded 0.01 feet.  Table 1 lists LNAPL thicknesses measured by both 
the interface probe and the bailer.  The following monitoring wells indicated the presence of LNAPL by the 
interface probe: 
 

 RW-101 on November 29, 2012 (<0.1 ft.); 
 RW-104 on November 29, 2012 (<0.01 ft.); 
 GP111-MW on November 30, 2012 (<0.01 ft); and 
 GP201-MW on October 31, 2012 (<0.01 ft.). 

 
The above measurable thicknesses have been succeeded by non-measurable separate phase conditions. 
 
5.1.5 Separate Phase Petroleum Recovery Methodology 
 
Since July 20, 2008 REMSERV, Inc. staff, TMC and LaMountain field personnel, and a representative of 
Route 16 Gas LLC have gauged and manually bailed separate phase product from monitoring and recovery

wells located at the site (Figure 4).  From July 21 to November 26, 2008 bailed petroleum was placed in on-
site frac tanks.  On November 26, 2008 the on-site frac tanks were emptied of all remaining liquids by United 
Industrial Service of Stoughton, MA (United Industrial) vac trucks.  On December 5, 2008 the two on-site 
frac tanks were cleaned by United Industrial in preparation for removal from the site.  LaMountain removed 
the frac tanks on December 16, 2008.  Recovered petroleum is currently stored on site in a covered and bolted 
55-gallon drum located atop a spill containment tray.  During gauging and recovery events, the Keck Passive 
Product Recovery Canisters (PRCs) are checked for product, emptied into a 55-gallon drum and redeployed.    
Recovered petroleum is intermittently transported off-site for use in a waste-oil heater located at another 
petroleum dispensing station operated by the PRP.   
 
Passive Product Recovery Canisters 
 
On November 2, 2011 two PRCs (PRC4 and PRC-5) were deployed in RW-101 (Figure 2).  The PRCs have 
varying reservoir volumes depending on the individual canister diameter and length.  The two PRCs installed 
in RW-101 have a smaller capacity reservoir and can therefore be placed at a lower elevation within the 
recovery well column.  One PRC each was deployed in RW-102 (PRC-2), RW-103 (PRC-3) and GP303-MW 
(PRC-6).   
 
On January 9, 2012, two PRCs were deployed in RW-101 (PRC4 and PRC-5).  One PRC each was deployed 
in RW-102 (PRC-2), RW-103 (PRC-3) and GP303-MW (PRC-6).   
 
On July 31, 2012, the PRCs were all removed from their respective wells and their product was emptied into 
the 55-gallon drum and the canisters were left out of their respective wells overnight.  Only canister PRC-6 
was deployed in GP105-MW. 
 
On August 1, 2012, two PRCs were deployed in RW-101(PRC4 and PRC-5).  One PRC each were deployed 
in RW-102 (PRC-2), RW-103 (PRC-3) and GP105-MW (PRC-6). 
 
Following the completion of each gauging event REMSERV, Inc. removed and emptied each PRC of its 
contents.  Prior to redeploying the PRCs, REMSERV, Inc. staff gauged each well over an approximately 45 
minute period to check each well for LNAPL recharge.      
 
Separate Phase Petroleum Recovery Summary – January 2012 to October 2012 
 
REMSERV, Inc. conducted three (3) petroleum recovery events at the site between January 2012 and 
October 2012 (January 09, 2012, July 31, 2012, and August 1, 2012).  During the three events a REMSERV, 
Inc. representative emptied any product recovered by the PRCs and conducted product recovery via manual 
bailing, if necessary.   
 
On January 9, 2012, approximately 0.8 liters of petroleum were recovered from RW-101 while less than 0.1 
liters were recovered from the other wells.  On July 31, 2012, 0.074 liters were recovered from RW-101 
while less than 0.1 liters were recovered from the other wells.  On August 1, 2012, less than 0.1 liters were 
recovered from GP105-MW, and it was the only canister which had been deployed the previous day. 
  
The product recovery volumes for these events have been summarized on Table 2. 
 
5.1.6 Groundwater Sampling 
 
Monitoring wells were not sampled for laboratory analytical testing between October 12, 2012 and June 18, 
2013.

5.1.7 Utility Survey and Indoor Air Assessment 
 
On July 21 and 31, 2008 REMSERV, Inc. conducted a utility vapor survey that included sanitary and storm 
water sewer manholes and catch basins located within the Cedar Street (Route 85) and East Main Street 
(Route 16) roadways in the vicinity of the site.  REMSERV, Inc. recorded total volatile organic compound 
(TVOC) readings using a Thermoelectron 580B photoionization detector (PID).  REMSERV, Inc. also 
gauged sanitary and storm water sewer systems for the presence of light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) 
with a Solinst Interface Probe paired with a polyethylene bailer.     
 
During both utility survey events REMSERV, Inc. did not identify elevated PID readings in any of the utility 
systems surveyed.  On July 31, 2008 a REMSERV, Inc. representative and Mr. Michael Santora of the 
Milford Engineering Department located and observed the storm sewer system discharge location 
downstream of the site.  The REMSERV, Inc. representative did not identify the presence of LNAPL using 
the Solinst Interface Probe nor did they observe a visible sheen on the storm water surface or on surface 
waters located downstream of the discharge location.    
 
Indoor Air Assessment – 3 Cedar Street and 112 East Main Street 
 
On July 21 and 31, 2008 REMSERV, Inc. conducted an indoor air survey at the 3 Cedar Street and 112 East 
Main Street residences abutting the 106 East Main Street property to the north and east, respectively.  The 
REMSERV, Inc. representative was accompanied by representatives of the Milford Fire Department during 
each indoor air survey event.  REMSERV, Inc. screened the indoor air of each residence using a 
Thermoelectron 580B PID and made visual observations that included the basement floor construction, the 
presence of floor penetrations including floor sumps and/or drains, evidence of basement flooding as a result 
of high water table conditions, as well as any visual or olfactory evidence of diesel fuel impacts from the 
adjacent property.  REMSERV, Inc. did not identify TVOC readings elevated above the minimum detection 
limits of the PID in either residence.  REMSERV, Inc. did not observe any visual or olfactory evidence of 
petroleum impact to either residence.  REMSERV, Inc. did not observe the presence of floor penetrations 
(sumps or drains) indicative of basement flooding as a result of high water table conditions.   
 
5.1.8 UST Removal  
 
On July 23, 2008 LaMountain excavated the 6,000-gallon single-wall fiberglass diesel UST.  On July 23 and 
July 24, 2008 LaMountain excavated the 8,000-gallon single-wall fiberglass super unleaded gasoline UST 
and the 10,000-gallon single-wall fiberglass regular unleaded UST.  Associated double-wall fiberglass 
product piping was also excavated as part of the UST removal activities. 
 
As part of the UST removal event, LaMountain excavated nine (9) test pits to identify the potential extent of 
the diesel UST release (Figure 2).  REMSERV, Inc. collected soil samples from each test pit for jar-
headspace field screening and laboratory analyses.  REMSERV, Inc. collected nine (9) soil samples from the 
test pit program and submitted them to Alpha Analytical Laboratories of Westborough, MA (Alpha) for 
analysis according to the MassDEP Volatile Petroleum Hydrocarbon (VPH) and Extractable Petroleum 
Hydrocarbon (EPH) Methods.  Laboratory analytical results and data sheets have been previously provided in 
the April 3, 2012 REMSERV, Inc. Phase II CSA Report.   
 
Test Pit Analytical Results 
 
The test pit soil analytical results identified the greatest VPH and EPH Method fraction concentrations in TP-
2, TP-3, TP-4, and TP-5 in the immediate vicinity of the initial UST excavation (Figure 2).  Soil samples 
were collected between nine (9) and 13.5 feet below ground surface.  Three test pits advanced to the east of 
the excavation (TP-6, TP-7, and TP-9) did not exhibit EPH Method fractions or target analytes at

concentrations indicative of potential impact due to the diesel UST release.  Test pit TP-1, advanced at the 
southwest corner of the 106 E. Main Street property exhibited low concentrations of VPH and EPH fractions 
and target analytes. 
 
5.1.9 Diesel fuel UST records 
 
The MassDEP obtained inventory records from the Route 16 Gas, LLC representative present at the site 
during the initial emergency response activities.   
 
5.1.10 2008 Soil Excavation 
 
LaMountain excavated approximately 175 yd³ of petroleum impacted soils during the UST removal and test 
pit activities.  On July 29, 2008 LaMountain transported approximately 138 yds³ to Ted Ondrick Company of 
Chicopee, MA (Ted Ondrick) for asphalt batch processing under the BWSC-012 Bill of Lading (BOL).  On 
October 20, 2008 the remaining volume of soils generated during the UST removal and test pit activities 
(approximately 36.74 yds³) was transported to Ted Ondrick under the BOL.   
 
Recovery Well Installations 
 
During the test pit and UST removal activities LaMountain installed eight (8) recovery wells at the site 
consisting of 12 to 18 inch diameter black ADS polyethylene piping cross-drilled to allow for 
groundwater/product recovery.  The recovery wells were installed at locations where monitoring wells and 
vapor extraction wells indicated the greatest diesel fuel volumes present.  The recovery wells were installed 
between two (2) and four (4) feet below the water table. 
 
Soil Excavation Event – November to December 2008 
 
From November 18 through December 8, 2008, a REMSERV, Inc. representative observed Regional 
Industrial Services (RIS) of Bellingham, MA in conjunction with Framingham Excavating of Ashland, MA 
excavate petroleum contaminated soils in the former UST excavation, along the western property boundary 
and along the northern property boundary (Figure 2).  RIS installed large-diameter dewatering wells in the 
southwest and the northeast corners of the proposed excavation area in order to allow for excavation of soils 
below the water table.  Dewatering pumps were installed in the recovery wells and discharged to the two on-
site fractionation tanks provided by La Mountain.  From November 20 through November 26, a total of 
32,135 gallons of petroleum impacted water from the fractionation tanks were removed via vac truck and 
transported off-site for treatment by United Industrial Services of Meriden, CT to Environmental Compliance 
Corporation of Stoughton, MA or United Oil Recovery of Meriden, CT under Hazardous Waste Manifest.   
 
Soils were excavated to an approximate depth of 14 to 15 feet except for the location of the UST mat in the 
northeast excavation corner, which was excavated to approximately 11 feet below ground surface.  
Petroleum-impacted soils excavated on November 20 and 21, 2008 were stockpiled on six (6) mm 
polyethylene sheeting in the southwest corner of the property along with previously excavated soils. 
 
REMSERV, Inc. extended the eastern boundary of the excavation trench adjacent to the sales kiosk.  Soils 
excavated from November 26 through December 1, 2008 to a depth of between 14 and 15 feet below ground 
surface were stockpiled south of the sales kiosk.  The eastern extent of the excavation was terminated when it 
was determined that any further excavation may compromise the foundation of the sales kiosk and/or 
destabilize soils beneath the fractionation tank (Figure 2).

2008 Soil Transport for Off-site Asphalt-Batch Recycling  
 
On December 3 and December 8, 2008, 1,176.86 tons (approximately 784.58 yards3) of petroleum-impacted 
soil from the additional excavation activities conducted from November 18 to December 1, 2008 were 
transported under the BWSC-012 Bill of Lading (BOL) by Sam’s Transportation of Georgetown, MA to 
Aggregate Recycling Corporation of Eliot, ME. 
 
REMSERV, Inc. did not collect confirmatory samples from the excavation side-walls during 2008 excavation 
activities as the extent of contamination had been previously established during the August 2008 soil boring 
event detailed in Section 5.0.  Confirmatory samples from the excavation floor could not be collected due to 
the presence of ground water within the excavation trench.  Confirmatory samples from within the excavation 
area were discussed in greater detail in previous IRA status reports, and are detailed in Section 5.0 of this 
report.  
 
2008 Excavation Backfill Activities 
 
From November 21 through December 4, 2009 REMSERV, Inc. observed as RIS and Framingham 
Excavating backfilled the excavation with “virgin” fill provided by McIntyre Loam Company of Hopkinton, 
MA.  On November 21, 2008, the southwest portion of the trench was backfilled to within four (4) feet of site 
grade in order to provide access for continued excavation activities in the north and east sections of the 
trench.  On November 25, 2008, the north section of the trench was backfilled to within four feet of surface 
grade.  The remainder of the excavation trench was backfilled between November 26 and December 2, 2008. 
 
Following backfilling activities, four-foot diameter concrete risers housing man-hole covers were installed 
around three (3) of the eight (8) recovery wells (RW101 to RW103).  
 
On December 24, 2008, an eight-inch layer of reground asphalt (“Mac-Pack”) provided by McIntyre Loam 
Co. was placed at ground surface.  The reground asphalt was compacted to a thickness of six-inches using the 
front-end loader and the bucket of the excavator. 
 
Completion of 2008 Excavation Activities 
 
On December 16, 2008, a REMSERV, Inc. representative returned to the site and removed petroleum 
absorbent “socks” and hay bales which had been placed within the perimeter of the property.  The absorbent 
materials were sealed in 55-gallon drums and disposed of by Pro-Tech Automotive of Waltham, MA.  The 
hay bales have been stockpiled atop six (6) mil polyethylene sheeting and covered with polyethylene sheeting 
to await disposal. 
 
On December 16, 2008, LaMountain removed the two (2) on-site frac tanks and the temporary fence that had 
been placed around the property during excavation activities.  Field and lab analytical results have been 
discussed in previous IRA Status Reports. 
 
5.2 Recent IRA Activities 
 
REMSERV, Inc. filed an “IRA Addendum No. 1” dated October 04, 2011 for the removal of the attendant 
building, dewatering, excavation and off-site recycling of approximately 250 yd3 of soils.  The soils and 
petroleum were remnant from the 2008 soil excavation activities and were a continuing source of separate 
phase petroleum in recovery wells RW101 through RW103 immediately west of the building.

On October 30, 2012 REMSERV, Inc. filed an October 30, 2012 “IRA Plan Addendum No. 2” seeking 
MassDEP approval for the excavation of an additional 200 cubic yards of petroleum impacted soil for 
removal.   
 
5.2.1 2012 Soil Excavation 
 
In March 2012 Macone Brothers, Inc. demolished the kiosk building to permit access to the underlying soils.  
From October 1 through 11, 2012, REMSERV, Inc. representatives observed Macone Brothers, Inc. of 
Sudbury, MA excavate petroleum contaminated soils from beneath the former kiosk location and from two 
areas along the western property boundary with Cedar Street (Figure 2).  Soils were removed from 
Excavations A, B and C as shown on Figure 2 to an approximate depth of fifteen (15) feet.  As previously 
mentioned, the soils at these locations were the source of separate phase petroleum identified in recovery 
wells and monitoring wells located within or adjacent to these areas.  Petroleum-impacted soils were 
stockpiled on six (6) millimeter polyethylene sheeting in the south central portion of the property.  A 
REMSERV, Inc. representative assessed soils as they were excavated for the visual and olfactory presence of 
petroleum hydrocarbons.  Soil samples were field screened by a photoionization detector (PID) and are 
discussed in Section 6.0.  Between October 1 and November 30, 2012 approximately 707 tons of impacted 
soil was transported off site for recycling to Aggregate Recycling Corporation in Eliot, ME.  Dewatering 
pumps were installed various locations during excavation and discharged to an on-site fractionation tanks 
located along the southern property boundary.  Throughout the excavation approximately forty-five thousand 
(45,000) gallons of ground water was discharged from the subsurface, containerized and transported off-site 
to New Stream, LLC in Attleboro, MA.   
 
Excavation A 
 
Excavation A soils were the source of LNAPL identified in monitoring wells RW-101.  Between October 1 
and October 5, 2012 dewatering and excavation activities took place to determine the northeastern and 
southern extents of contamination beneath the former kiosk.  Excavation A encompassed an approximately 
1,126 square foot area to an approximate depth of sixteen (16) feet below ground surface (Figure 2).  
Dewatering was achieved by permanent recovery well RW-101 and by varying the locations four (4) 
temporary dewatering wells (RW-Q, RW-A, RW-B and RW-C).  One hundred seventy-eight (178) cubic 
yards (263.38 tons) was transported off site to Aggregate Recycling Company of Eliot, ME.  Monitoring well 
GP304-MW was destroyed during Excavation A.   
 
Excavation B 
 
Soils located in Excavation B were the source of LNAPL contamination identified in GP-109, GP-111 and 
GP-112.  Excavation B was advanced between October 9 and 10, 2012 in the southwest corner of the site 
along Cedar Street.  Dewatering well RW-A installed and pumped at a rate of 2.5 gallons per minute (gpm) to 
lower the water table in this area.  Excavation B encompassed approximately 735 square feet to an 
approximate depth of fifteen (15) feet below ground surface.  Soils removed from the excavation were 
stockpiled into three piles based color and PID reading.  The excavation began in the southern corner and 
extended northwards.  The south end of the excavation was backfilled within two feet of site grade in order to 
better stabilize the excavation sidewalls.  Monitoring well MW-305 was destroyed during excavation of 
Excavation B.  Temporary dewatering well RW-A was pulled before the south end of the excavation was 
backfilled and RW-C was installed in the north end of the trench to continue dewatering activities as 
excavation was advanced at Excavation C.

Excavation C 
 
On October 11, 2012 dewatering well RW-D was installed in Excavation C and pumped at rate of 
approximately ten (10) gpm.  Macone Brothers advanced a twenty (20) foot wide by twenty-two (22) foot 
long excavation in the north west corner of the site.  Backfill activities continued at from the south end of 
Excavation B.  Dewatering continued from RW-102 during Excavation C.  Monitoring well GP-303 was 
destroyed during Excavation C activities.   
 
6.0 Soil PID Screening Results 
 
REMSERV, Inc. collected thirty one samples from Excavation A and B during the October 10 to 12, 2012 
soil excavation event.  Eight (8) samples were collected from Excavation A, eight (8) samples were collected 
from Excavation B, ten (10) samples were collected from Excavation C and five (5) samples were collected 
from Stockpile B (Figure 2).  Soil samples were field screened using the MassDEP jar-headspace method for 
Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) using a Phocheck® Tiger photoionization detector (PID) 
equipped with a 10.6eV ultraviolet source calibrated to a 100 ppmv isobutylene standard.  The PID was 
calibrated to an isobutylene standard and was programmed to read in benzene equivalents using the
