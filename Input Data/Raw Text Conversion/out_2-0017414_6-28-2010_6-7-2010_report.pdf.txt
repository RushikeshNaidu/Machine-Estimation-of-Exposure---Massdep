To Whom It May Concern: 

AECOM Environment (AECOM) has prepared this Immediate Response Action Completion (IRAC) 
Report for the above-referenced disposal site on behalf of Cumberland Farms, Inc. (CFI).  The 
following report is being submitted to address Release Tracking Number (RTN) 2-17414 issued by 
the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on February 10, 2009.  The RTN 
was issued due to the presence of gasoline fuel identified within a submersible turbine pump (STP) 
sump further discussed below.  Based on the amount of gasoline within the STP sump being 
greater than 10 gallons, the spill was reported to the DEP within the 2 hour reporting timeline.  This 
document details the activities of the Immediate Response Action (IRA) activities completed from 
February 10, 2009 through May 10, 2010.  This IRAC Report is being submitted as an Attachment 
to the IRA Completion Statement Transmittal Form (BWSC-105).  Information required for an IRA 
Completion Statement, as specified in 310 CMR 40.0427, is contained in this document as a whole.   

Implementation of this IRA acted as an accelerated response action to prevent, eliminate, and/or 
minimize damage to health, safety, public welfare or the environment which may result from the 
contamination identified at the site.  All opinions and recommendations made in this report are 
based on the work performed by AECOM and are subject to the service constraints included as 
Attachment A.

1.0 Background Information 

1.1 Description of the Release 
• On February 10, 2009, at approximately 10:49 am, approximately 25 gallons of gasoline 

were released from an STP pump to the STP sump associated with the regular grade 
underground storage tank (UST).  The release was discovered following an alarm 
associated with the STP sump.  It is AECOM’s understanding that the release was 
contained within the STP sump.  The spill was reported to the DEP as a release/spill 
greater than 10 gallons on February 10, 2009 at 12:13 pm.  The DEP granted verbal IRA 
approval to perform cleanup activities, investigation and evaluation, including removal of 
product from the sump, assessment of impact to the environment/indoor air and repair of 
the leak.  Following notification, Mr. Bob Dunn from the DEP issued RTN 2-17414.    

1.2 Site Conditions 
• The site is a CFI retail gasoline station and convenience store located at 1289 Main Street 

within a mixed commercial and residential zoned area in the City of Leominster, Worcester 
County, Massachusetts.  Properties abutting the site include a residential property to the 
east, a former CVS to the south, Main Street to the west, beyond which a restaurant and 
North Street to the north, beyond which is a video store.  

• According to the Leominster Tax Assessors’, the site has been owned by VSH Realty, Inc. 
since July 29, 1982.  Prior to this the site was owned by Mobile Foundation, Inc since 
November 24, 1981 and Mobil Oil Corporation since March 5, 1959.  Therefore, it is 
assumed that the facility has been used as a retail gasoline station since at least 1959.   

• The site currently consists of a convenience store building, three 8,000-gallon single-walled 
fiberglass USTs that were installed in August 1982, and two gasoline dispenser islands. 

• Figure 1 identifies the regional location of the facility.  Figure 2 and Figure 3 depicts the site 
and Figure 4 is a copy of the January 29, 2010 NRS Map.   

1.3 Potential Receptors 
• On February 9, 2010, AECOM submitted a Phase I Initial Site Investigation (Phase I) to the 

DEP.  Based on information presented within the Phase I, the MADEP Site Scoring Map 
indicated no public water supplies or associated Zone II are located within 500 feet of the 
site.   In addition, according to the MADEP Site Scoring Map, an Interim Wellhead 
Protection Area is located approximately 3,500 feet east of the site and the site is not 
located within a Potentially Productive Aquifer.  It should be noted that a medium yield 
Potentially Productive Aquifer is located approximately 4,200 feet southwest of the site.   
According to the Environmental Data Resources, Inc. (EDR) presented within the Phase I, 
there are no private wells within 500 feet of the site.  It should be noted that according to a 
representative of the city of Leominster Water Department and the City of Leominster Board 
of Health contacted on January 28, 2010, there are no private wells within 500 feet of the 
site.  A detailed map was pieced together during the preparation of the Phase I with 
information provided by the town and no drinking water wells were identified within 500’ 
from the site.  In addition, AECOM contacted the Leominster Board of Health on June 1, 
2010 and spoke to Christopher Knouth.  Mr. Knouth indicated that the site was NOT within 
an Aquifer Protection District or Watershed area.

• Lake Whalom is located approximately 3,000 feet north-northeast of the site and an 
unnamed river is located approximately 1,300 feet east of the site. In addition, wetland 
habitat is located approximately 1,500 feet southeast of the site.  

• The facility is located in a mixed commercial/residential area of Leominster, Massachusetts:   

o North – North Street, beyond which is a video store 

o South – Former CVS Pharmacy, beyond which are residential properties 

o West – Main Street, beyond which is the Weathervane Restaurant 

o East – Residential properties 

1.4 Groundwater and Soil Classification 

• Categories of groundwater and soil have been established in the Massachusetts 
Contingency Plan (MCP) for use in Risk Characterization.  These categories are used to 
determine the applicability of the Method 1 Standards, as well as any other applicable or 
suitably analogous standards.  Only one soil category is applicable to particular soils 
(although different categories may be appropriate for soils in different parts of a site), while 
each of the groundwater categories may apply to groundwater at the site. 

• Based on current site use and activities, soil at the disposal site is classified as S-3 
because the soil is potentially accessible (greater than 3 feet deep), children are present at 
low frequency, and on-site activities are low intensity.  In order to be conservative and 
provide for unlimited future use of the disposal site, soil concentrations were also compared 
to the most stringent S-1 standards. 

• Based on the review of the NRS map and information provided to AECOM, groundwater 
beneath the disposal site is classified as GW-2 within 30 feet of the existing occupied 
building because the average annual depth to groundwater in that area was observed to be 
less than 15 feet.  GW-1 does not apply to the site since there are no current and/or 
potential drinking water source areas located near the facility.  As defined in 310 CMR 
40.0932, all groundwater at disposal sites shall be considered a potential source of 
discharge to surface water and therefore, GW-3 standards also apply to the site. 

2.0 Immediate Response Action 

Per the requirements of the MCP 310 CMR 40.0311(2) (b), 2-hour reporting conditions require the 
implementation of an IRA.  The purpose of the IRA was to remove the source(s) of gasoline 
contamination and to implement response actions designed to evaluate if a potential Imminent 
Hazard (IH) Critical Exposure Pathway (CEP) or Substantial Release Migration (SRM) condition 
exists at the site as a result of the release.  The following information describes the response 
actions implemented at the site.   

2.1 Description of IRA Actions Completed to Date 
The following information has been discussed in previous submittals: 

• As discussed in the IRA Plan submitted to DEP on April 17, 2009, on February 10, 2009, 
following the identification of gasoline in the STP sump, CFI personnel shut down the

facility.  CYN Environmental of Stoughton, MA (CYN) responded to the release and 
pumped approximately 70 gallons of a gasoline/water mixture from the three UST sumps.  It 
is our understanding that approximately 25 gallons of gasoline was removed from the STP 
sump of the regular grade UST and that the remaining 45 gallons of liquid was pumped out 
of the other two UST sumps.  The material was shipped off-site under a non-hazardous 
waste manifest to an authorized facility, EPS of Vermont located in Glenmont, NY.   

• Tyree Organization of Westborough, MA (Tyree) responded to the release to repair a faulty 
o-ring associated with the functional element on the STP.  AECOM personnel arrived on-
site at 14:00 to assess potential impacts to the environment.  Following completion of the 
repair made by Tyree, the pump was turned back on and Tyree personnel completed an 
inspection; there was no indication of a continued leak.  It should be noted that there were 
approximately 10 gallons of frozen water at the bottom of the STP sump at the time of the 
release.       

• At the time of AECOM’s inspection, there was no olfactory evidence of vapor impacts to the 
convenience store building.  In addition, a requirement specified in the Notice of 
Responsibility (NOR) was to screen any subsurface structures in the immediate area with 
an explosive gas meter to determine if any Imminent Hazard (IH) conditions exist and 
whether any of those structures have been impacted with gasoline.  This was not 
completed due to the lack of subsurface structures in the immediate area of the release.   

• On March 5, 2009, Tanknology, Inc. of Austin, Texas (Tanknology) was on-site to conduct 
confirmation tightness testing of the fuel line associated with the regular grade UST, which 
includes the STP pump that was repaired.  Based on the test results, the fuel line tested 
tight. 

• On April 16, 2009, Tanknology was on-site to conduct a hydrostatic test of the STP sump 
for the regular grade UST.  The hydrostatic test was conducted to evaluate the competency 
of the sump.  Based on the test results, the STP sump failed the tightness test.  This was 
verbally communicated to AECOM on April 16, 2009.   

• On April 17, 2009, Tanknology returned to the site and made the necessary repairs to the 
STP sump based on the April 16th STP hydrostatic failing results.  Following the repairs, 
Tanknology conducted an additional hydrostatic test on the STP sump to verify that the 
repairs worked and that the sump was tight.  Based on the results of the second hydrostatic 
test, the STP sump tested tight. 

• On June 12, 2009, AECOM oversaw the advancement of three monitoring wells (MW-1 
through MW-3) by Technical Drilling Services (TDS) of Sterling, Massachusetts.  Refer to 
Figures 2 and 3 for locations of monitoring wells. The purpose of the monitoring well 
installation was to assess potential impacts to soil and groundwater as a result of the failed 
STP sump discussed above.  Three 2-inch monitoring wells were installed utilizing a hollow 
stem auger rig to a total depth of 18-feet below surface grade (BSG).  Soil samples were 
collected continuously with depth at each boring utilizing split spoons.  Soil samples 
collected from each boring were field screened with a photoionization detector (PID) meter 
for the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  PID readings ranged from 17.9 
parts-per-million (ppm) to 1,780 ppm within the boring for monitoring well MW-1 (B1).  Field 
screening of soil samples from the borings for monitoring well MW-2 (B2)  monitoring well 
MW-3 (B3) ranged from BDL to >2,000 ppm.  Groundwater was encountered between 12 
and 14 feet BSG in monitoring well MW-1, at approximately 10-11 feet BSG in monitoring 
well MW-2 and between 8-10 feet within monitoring well MW-3.  Soil samples were

collected from the 2-4 foot and 8-16 foot range for monitoring well MW-1, MW-2 and from 
the 2-4 foot and 4-14 foot range for monitoring well MW-3.  Soil samples were submitted to 
GeoLabs (GEO) of Braintree Massachusetts for laboratory analysis of Volatile Petroleum 
Hydrocarbons (VPH).   

• Based on the soil analytical results for the June 12, 2009 drilling event, C5-C8 aliphatic 
hydrocarbons were detected above Method 1 S-1/GW-2 and S-1/GW-3 standards in soil 
borings MW-1 (8-16’), MW-2 (8-16’) and MW-3 (4-14’).  C9-C10 aromatic hydrocarbons 
were also noted above the Method 1 S-1 standards within the soil boring for monitoring well 
MW-3 (4-14’).  Soil analytical results are presented in Table 1. 

• On July 10, 2009, AECOM personnel surveyed three monitoring wells (MW-1 through MW-
3) to an arbitrary datum (southwest corner of the CFI facility) to 100’ above mean sea level. 

• On July 10, 2009, prior to collecting groundwater samples, AECOM developed monitoring 
wells MW-1, MW-2 and MW-3 which were installed on June 12, 2009.   

• On July 10, 2009, AECOM gauged and sampled groundwater from monitoring wells MW-1 
through MW-3.  AECOM did not identify any Light non aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) within 
the three newly installed monitoring wells (MW1 through MW-3).  Samples were submitted 
to GEO for analysis of VPH and analytical results indicated concentrations above the 
applicable standards within monitoring wells MW-2 and MW-3.  Please refer to the historical 
groundwater sampling table (Table 2).  

• In an effort to further delineate soil and groundwater impacts, on September 23, 2009, 
AECOM oversaw the advancement of three monitoring wells (MW-4 through MW-6) by 
TDS.  Refer to Figures 2 and 3 for locations of wells MW-4 through MW-6.  Three 2-inch 
monitoring wells were installed to a total depth of 15-feet BSG utilizing a hollow stem auger 
rig.  Soil samples were collected continuously at each boring location utilizing split spoons.  
Soil samples collected from each boring were field screened with a PID meter for the 
presence of VOCs.  PID readings ranged from BDL to >2,000 ppm within monitoring well 
MW-4 (B4), BDL to 1,631 ppm and from BDL to 1,347 ppm in the boring for monitoring 
wells MW-4, MW-5 and MW-6 respectively.  Groundwater was encountered between 7 and 
9 feet BSG in monitoring wells MW-4, MW-5 and MW-6.  Soil samples were collected from 
the 8-12 foot range from the boring for monitoring well MW-4, the 9-14 foot and 14.5-15 foot 
range from the boring for monitoring well MW-5 and from the 7-13 foot range from the 
boring for monitoring well MW-6.  Soil samples were submitted to GEO for laboratory 
analysis of VPH.   

• Based on the soil analytical results for the September 23, 2009 drilling event, C5-C8 
aliphatic hydrocarbons were detected above Method 1 S-1/GW-2 and S-1/GW-3 standards 
in soil borings MW-4 (8-12’), MW-5 (9-14’)(14.5-15’) and MW-6 (7-13’).  The C9-C10 
aromatic hydrocarbons were analyzed for the borings associated with monitoring wells MW-
5 (9-14’) and MW-6 (7-13’) were above the Method 1 S-1 standards.  In addition, xylenes 
were detected in the soil sample associated with monitoring well MW-4 (8-12’) above the 
Method 1 S-1/GW-2 and S-1/GW-3 standards.  Soil analytical results are presented in 
Table 1. 

• On September 23, 2009 during the installation of monitoring wells MW-4 through MW-6, 
monitoring well MW-3 was gauged and AECOM personnel identified 0.25 inches LNAPL 
within monitoring well MW-3 utilizing a polyethylene bailer.  Following the detection of 
LNAPL within monitoring well MW-3, AECOM conducted periodic gauging events using an

oil water interface probe on September 25, September 30 and October 8, 2009. Based on 
the three gauging events, LNAPL levels slowly decreased from .09’, .09’ to .04’ 
respectively. It should be noted that following each gauging event, the LNAPL thickness in 
well MW-3 was also checked using a 2” disposable bailer.  Based on the measured LNAPL 
thickness within the bailer, LNAPL levels were measured at less than 1/2 inch on each of 
those three occasions.  LNAPL has not been detected within any of the other wells 
associated with RTN 2-17414.  Please refer to Table 3 for historical gauging results.  

• On September 30, 2009, AECOM personnel surveyed three monitoring wells (MW-4 
through MW-6) and tied them into the existing well elevations. 

• On September 30, 2009, AECOM personnel performed a soil gas survey adjacent to the 
southern wall of the facility building in order to evaluate the potential for impacts to indoor 
air.  Using the approach documented in the October 2002 implementation of the DEP 
VPH/Extractable Petroleum Hydrocarbon (EPH) Approach, AECOM installed two soil gas 
probes (SG-1 and SG-2) along the southern wall of the facility.  The probes were 
constructed of copper and were advanced by hand to a depth of approximately 3.5 to 4-feet 
BSG in order to facilitate the collection of a sample from just below the lowest (building 
footing) elevation within the facility structure.  Using a PID (calibrated to isobutylene) the 
soil gas probes were purged for approximately ten minutes and screened every minute for 
volatile vapors during the purging process.  PID screening results for both locations were 
recorded as below the instrument detection limits.  Please refer to Figure 2 for the location 
of the soil gas points. 

• On October 8, 2009, AECOM gauged the six site wells and collected groundwater samples 
from monitoring wells MW-1, MW-2, MW-4 through MW-6.  It should be noted that 
groundwater sample was not collected from monitoring well MW-3 based on the presence 
of LNAPL.  Samples were submitted to GEO for analysis of VPH and analytical results 
indicated groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells MW-1, MW-2, MW-4 and 
MW-6 exceeded the applicable standards for one or more VPH constituents and well MW-5 
was below the applicable standard.  Please refer to Table 2 for a summary of the 
groundwater analytical results.    

The following information has not been discussed in previous submittals: 

• On January 8, 2010, AECOM gauged the six site wells and collected groundwater samples 
from monitoring wells MW-1, MW-2 and MW-4 through MW-6.  It should be noted that 
groundwater sample was not collected from monitoring well MW-3 based on the presence 
of a skim of LNAPL.  Please refer to Table 3 for historical LNAPL and groundwater gauging 
results. Samples were submitted to GEO for analysis of VPH and analytical results 
indicated groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells MW-1, MW-2, MW-4 and 
MW-6 exceeded the applicable standards for one or more VPH constituents.  Please refer 
to Table 2 for a summary of the groundwater analytical results and Attachment B for a copy 
of the laboratory analytical report.    

• On April 2, 2010, AECOM personnel installed a permanent soil gas point (SG-1A) and 
performed a soil gas survey adjacent to the southern wall of the facility building in order to 
evaluate the potential for impacts to indoor air.  This vapor point was installed as a 
permanent point so future vapor screening activities could be conducted.  Using the 
approach documented in the October 2002 implementation of the DEP VPH/EPH 
Approach, AECOM installed one soil gas probe, SG-1A, along the southern wall of the 
facility.  The probe was constructed of copper and was advanced by hand to a depth of

approximately 3.5 to 4-feet BSG in order to facilitate the collection of a sample from just 
below the lowest (building footing) elevation within the facility structure.  Using a PID 
(calibrated to isobutylene) the soil gas probe was purged for approximately ten minutes and 
screened every minute for volatile vapors.  PID screening results for the location was 
recorded as below the instrument detection limits.  Please refer to Figure 2 for the location 
of the soil gas points. 

• On April 7, 2010, AECOM gauged the six site monitoring wells and collected groundwater 
samples from monitoring wells MW-1 through MW-6.  It should be noted that LNAPL was 
not detected within well MW-3 during this gauging event; therefore a groundwater sample 
was collected from well MW-3.  Samples were submitted to GEO for analysis of VPH and 
analytical results indicated groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells MW-3 and 
MW-4 exceeded the applicable standards for one or more VPH constituents.  Please refer 
to Table 2 for a summary of the groundwater analytical results and Attachment B for a copy 
of the laboratory analytical report.    

• In an effort to further delineate soil and groundwater impacts and evaluate a potential 
condition of Substantial Release Migration (SRM), on April 8, 2010, AECOM oversaw the 
advancement of four monitoring wells (MW-7 through MW-10) by TDS.  Refer to Figures 2 
and 3 for locations of wells MW-7 through MW-10.  Four 2-inch monitoring wells were 
installed to a total depth of 12-feet BSG utilizing a Geoprobe unit.  Soil samples were 
collected continuously at each boring location utilizing acetate Geoprobe liners.  Soil 
samples collected from each boring were field screened with a portable PID for the 
presence of VOCs.  PID readings ranged from BDL to 261 ppm, BDL to 2.5 ppm, BDL to 
2.5 ppm in the borings for monitoring wells MW-7, MW-8 and MW-9 respectively, and soil 
samples screened from the boring associated with well MW-10 were all BDL.  Groundwater 
was encountered between 8 and 9 feet BSG in monitoring wells MW-7 and MW-8, between 
7 and 8 feet BSG in monitoring well MW-9 and between 6 and 7 feet within well MW-10.  
Soil samples were collected from the 0 to 3 foot and 8 to 15 foot range from the boring for 
well MW-7 and 3 to 5 foot range from the boring for well MW-10. In addition, it should be 
noted that a duplicate sample from well MW-7 (8 to 15 foot range) was collected.  Soil 
samples were submitted to GEO for laboratory analysis of VPH.  Please refer to Attachment 
C for a copy of the boring logs and well completion reports for wells MW-7 through MW-10. 

• Based on the soil analytical results for the April 8, 2010 drilling event, soil concentrations 
were below the laboratory detection limit and/or below the applicable standard.  Soil 
analytical results are presented in Table 1 and copies of the laboratory analytical reports 
are included in Attachment B. 

• On April 15, 2010, prior to collecting groundwater samples, AECOM developed monitoring 
wells MW-7, MW-8, MW-9 and MW-10 which were installed on April 8, 2010.  In addition to 
well development and groundwater sampling, AECOM personnel surveyed the four new 
monitoring wells using monitoring well MW-6 as a known elevation to tie into the survey 
previously conducted at the site. 

• On April 15, 2010, AECOM gauged and sampled groundwater from monitoring wells MW-7 
through MW-10.  AECOM did not identify any LNAPL within the four newly installed 
monitoring wells (MW-7 through MW-10).  Samples were submitted to GEO for analysis of 
VPH and analytical results indicated xylene concentrations exceeded the applicable GW-3 
standards within monitoring well MW-7.  Please refer to the historical groundwater 
analytical results (Table 2).

• On April 30, 2010, AECOM returned to the site to complete a comprehensive gauging 
event.  AECOM gauged monitoring wells MW-1 through MW-10.  Based on the gauging 
data collected on April 30, 2010 it was determined that groundwater flow was to the north, 
northeast direction, which is consistent with historical groundwater flow data.  The April 30, 
2010 groundwater elevation and flow direction is depicted in Figure 3, Groundwater 
Topography Map. 

3.0 Substantial Hazard Evaluation 

Based on the recent soil gas air screening events (three in total) indicating that a direct 
exposure pathway currently does not exist from the soil gas points to the inside ambient air, no 
complete exposure pathways or risks to human health, safety, public welfare and the 
environment currently exist with respect to the site. 

4.0 Remediation Waste Disposition 

Cyn was on-site May 4, 2010 and removed 700 pounds of drill cuttings associated with the April 
8, 2010 drilling event and 55-gallons of well development water associated with well 
development activities conducted on April 15, 2010.   Please refer to the IRA Plan submitted to 
DEP on April 17, 2009, IRA Status # 1 submitted to DEP on June 16, 2009 and IRA Status #2 
submitted to DEP on December 9, 2009 for historical waste information.  Please refer to 
Attachment D for a copy of the non hazardous waste manifest. 

5.0 Findings of the IRA 

• On February 10, 2009, approximately 25 gallons of gasoline was released from a STP 
sump associated with the regular grade UST.  The spill was reported to the DEP as a 
release/spill greater than 10 gallons on February 10, 2009.  The DEP granted verbal IRA 
approval to perform cleanup activities, investigation and evaluation, including removal of 
product from the sump, assessment of impact to the environment/indoor air and repair of 
the leak.  Following notification, Mr. Bob Dunn from the DEP issued RTN 2-17414.  Per 310 
CMR 40.0412(1), a 2-hour reporting condition required the implementation of an IRA.  The 
purpose of the IRA was to remove the source(s) of gasoline contamination and to 
implement response actions designed to evaluate potential IH, CEP and SRM conditions.   

• In an effort to evaluate the potential for indoor air impacts, AECOM performed a soil gas 
survey adjacent to the southern wall of the facility building in order to evaluate the potential 
for indoor air impacts.  Using a PID, (calibrated to isobutylene) the soil gas probes were 
purged for approximately 10 minutes and screened every minute for volatile vapors.  PID 
screening for both (SG-1 and SG-2) were recorded as below the instrument detection limits.  
In addition, an additional permanent soil gas point (SG-1A) was installed.  AECOM purged 
the point for approximately 10 minutes and then screened it every minute for volatile 
vapors.  PID screening for (SG-1A) was recorded as below the instrument detection limits.  

• Based on the results of this survey, it is AECOM’s opinion that there are no potential 
imminent hazards for vapor migration into the facility building.   

• As indicated in the February 9, 2010 Phase I Report and based on the recent groundwater 
and soil analytical results collected, soil and groundwater impacts at the site are currently 
above the applicable Method 1 / GW-2 & GW-3 Standards.  Based on several air screening

events discussed above, these screening events ultimately dismiss vapor intrusion (GW-2 
standards within 30 feet from an occupied building) based on the lack of vapors detected 
during the air screening events.  In addition, based on the proximity of the nearest surface 
water body (Lake Whalom located approximately 3,000 feet north-northeast of the site) and 
that the furthest downgradient wells (MW-9 and MW-10) are below applicable groundwater 
standards, it is AECOMs opinion that groundwater can be ruled out as a potential discharge 
to surface water (GW-3).  Based on information collected and a review of laboratory 
analytical data, site conditions currently do not represent significant risk of harm to health, 
safety, public welfare or the environment.   

• Based on the results of the two soil gas screening events completed at the site, a pathway 
between the subsurface and the building does not currently exist.  AECOM will periodically 
screen vapor point SG-1A during future groundwater sampling events to ensure that a 
vapor pathway does not exist between the subsurface and the facility.  

• All remediation waste generated as part of this IRA has been properly removed from the 
site.  In AECOM’s opinion, the objectives of the IRA have been met:   

• The faulty o-ring associated with the functional element on the STP was repaired; 
• The leak in the STP sump was repaired; 
• Based on the investigation conducted, there are no IH, CEP or SRM conditions at 

the site. 
 
However, additional response actions are required to determine if a condition of significant 
risk to human health, safety, public welfare and the environment exists at the site.  This will 
be conducted under on-going Phase II response actions. 
 

Per the public notification requirements of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP), 310 CMR 
40.0000, public notification letters were submitted to the Leominster Department of Public Works for 
soil samples collected on April 8, 2010 and groundwater samples collected on April 15, 2010 on city 
property.  Copies of these letters are provided in Attachment E.

Service Constraints 

1. Preliminary Findings 
The following limitation is applicable if the report is stamped “DRAFT” or otherwise identified as 
preliminary: AECOM Inc. dba AECOM Environment (AECOM) has prepared this Preliminary Report 
at the specific request of the client.  Due to Client imposed time, information, and financial 
restrictions, AECOM has not performed the services necessary for it to render any opinions or 
reach any conclusions.  Accordingly, the studies, data, information, and findings contained in this 
Preliminary Report are not the final conclusions of AECOM, but merely basic information requested 
by the client upon which the Client may draw its own conclusions.  Client agrees that AECOM shall 
not be liable for any claims, loss, damage, or expenses incurred by the Client or others arising out 
of the use of, or reliance on, any information contained in this Preliminary Report.

To Whom It May Concern,

This letter and attached standardized form are intended to satisfy the public involvement
requirements outlined in the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) 310 CMR 40.1400. As you
are aware, AECOM Environment (AECOM), is providing environmental consulting services to our
client, Cumberland Farms, Inc. (CFI) at the above-referenced facility with respect to Release
Tracking Number (RTN) 2-17414 assigned by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP). AECOM, on behalf of CFI, installed four groundwater monitoring wells (MW-7,
MW-8, MW-9, and MW-10) in the right-of-way along North Street. On April 8, 2010, during the
installation of these monitoring wells soil samples were submitted for laboratory analysis from the
borings associated with monitoring wells MW-7 and MW-10. In addition, AECOM collected
groundwater samples from monitoring wells MW-7, MW-8, MW-9, and MW-10 on April 15, 2010 for
laboratory analysis. Pursuant to the MCP 310 CMR 40.1403 (10) (b), please find the laboratory
analytical report attached.

In addition, AECOM has included a soil table (Table 1) and a groundwater analytical table (Table 2)
summarizing the soil and groundwater analytical results for the samples collected from the North
Street right-of-way. In addition, copies of the laboratory analytical data are enclosed. Please refer
to the attached figure for the location of the wells and other pertinent site features.

AECOM, on behalf of CFI, is continuing our environmental investigation by conducting quarterly
groundwater sampling of the monitoring wells. The next sampling event is tentatively scheduled for
July 2010.
