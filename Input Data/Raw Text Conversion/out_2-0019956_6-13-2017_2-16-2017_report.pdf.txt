1.0 INTRODUCTION 

 

1.1 Purpose 

This document has been prepared by Cushing, Jammallo & Wheeler, Inc. (CJW) on behalf of The 

Kelly Company, Inc. in regard to a release of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which have been 

identified in soil and concrete at 179 Brook Street, Clinton, Massachusetts (the “site”) (Figures 1 

and 2).  It is being submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in accordance 

with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40 “Protection of the Environment”, Part 761, 

Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Manufacturing, Processing, Distribution in Commerce, and 

Use Prohibitions, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  More specifically, this revised 

document includes: 

 

 The Self-Implementing Procedure (SIP) Completion Report [40 CFR 761.61(a)] for the 

cleanup and disposal of PCB remediation waste including: 

 

o Notification [40 CFR 761.61(a)(3)] of the nature of the contamination; 

o A summary of the procedures used to sample contaminated and adjacent areas and a 

figure showing pre-cleanup characterization samples; and 

o The currently known lateral and vertical extent of the contamination. 

 

This document also constitutes an Immediate Response Action (IRA) Completion Report and a 

Permanent Solution Statement (PSS) with Conditions [No Activity and Use Limitation (AUL) 

Required] in accordance with the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) [310 CMR 40.0427, 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 2 

 

   

 

 

40.1040(1), and 40.1041(2), respectively].  The document, along with an IRA Transmittal Form 

(BWSC-105, and PSS Transmittal Form (BWSC-104), are being submitted to the Massachusetts 

Department of Environmental Protection (MA DEP), via eDEP. 

 

Since this PSS is being submitted to the MADEP more than 120 days but before one year from the 

release notification date of August 16, 2016. a $1,470 PSS fee is required to be submitted to the 

Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 

 

1.2 Regulatory Framework 

1.2.1 Toxic Substances Control Act 

This document is being submitted to the USEPA to satisfy the notification requirement as specified 

under 40 CFR 761.61(a)(3). 

 

The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA) provides the USEPA with authority to require 

reporting, record-keeping and testing requirements, and restrictions relating to chemical 

substances and/or mixtures.  TSCA addresses the production, importation, use, and disposal of 

specific chemicals including, among others, PCBs.   

 

TSCA applies to this matter because the oil within the former pad-mounted transformer (removed 

from the site as discussed in Section 12.1) at the site (Figure 4) was the most likely source of the 

PCBs identified in the adjacent soil and even though the highest total PCB concentration in soil 

was 12.9 mg/kg, the total concentration of PCBs identified in the transformer oil was 110 mg/kg 

which is greater than the TSCA trigger of 50 mg/kg.  Specifically, per 40 CFR 761.123, “the 

concentration of PCBs spilled is determined by the concentration of PCBs in the material spilled 

as opposed to the concentration of PCBs in the material [in this case, soil] onto which the PCBs 

were spilled”.   

 

Three (3) additional pole-mount type service transformers are currently active and staged on a 

raised wooden platform which spans between two (2) utility poles, located approximately 92 feet 

to the north of the PCB containing/TSCA regulated pad-mounted transformer (Figure 5).  Each of 

the three (3) pole-mount type transformers are furnished with blue certified non-PCB containing 

placards, each of which states that the mineral oil dielectric fluid (MODF) contained in each 

transformer contains less than 50 ppm PCBs based on sampling and testing of the transformer oil 

and, as such, is considered to be non-PCB pursuant to 40 CFR 761.3.  No other active or inactive 

oil filled transformers are known to be located at the site, as the only electrical service to the 

http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=BROWSE&TITLE=15USCC53

building enters from the southwestern corner of the site building adjacent to the pad-mounted 

transformer and continues, via overhead wires, to the platform containing the three (3) pole-

mounted transformers, and subsequently enters the northwestern portion of the site building 

thereafter.  

 

According to The Kelly Company, Inc., one (1) vacant concrete pad (removed during the 

excavation activities discussed in Section 6.4) was believed to have been occupied by two (2) pad-

mounted transformers prior to the installation of the PCB containing/TSCA regulated pad-mounted 

transformer previously discussed.  This vacant concrete pad was located within the fenced 

enclosure maintained by National Grid – Electric (Figure 4).  No records were available from the 

property owner or National Grid regarding the dates of installation/decommissioning or PCB 

content for the likely transformers that were previously located on this pad.  

 

Under TSCA, there are options for the cleanup and disposal of PCB remediation waste (40 CFR 

761.61).  They include a Self-Implementing Procedure (SIP) [761(a)], a Performance-Based 

Procedure [761.61(b)], and a Risk-Based Procedure [761.61(c)].  Work was proposed under the 

Self-Implementing Procedure (SIP) [761(a)] and, as such, the information presented in this 

document was used for the preparation and execution of a remedial plan that meets those 

requirements. 

 

1.2.2 Massachusetts Contingency Plan 

On May 18, 2016, CJW collected a sample of soil that abuts the pad-mounted transformer located 

just west of the portion of the building at the site that fronts along Brook Street.  The sample was 

submitted to a laboratory for analysis of PCBs.  The testing results identified two PCBs in the 

sample:  Aroclor 1254 in a concentration of 1.6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and Aroclor 1260 

in a concentration of 0.77 mg/kg.  

 

The Aroclor 1254 concentration of 1.6 mg/kg and the total concentration of both Aroclors of 2.37 

in soil exceeded the applicable Reportable Concentration (RC) for soil category RCS-1 of mg/kg 

under the MCP.  This condition initially represented a release which required notification by The 

Kelly Company, Inc. to the MA DEP within 120 days of The Kelly Company, Inc. obtaining 

knowledge of the release. 

 

However, testing of additional soil samples collected on August 9, 2016 revealed a total PCB 

concentration in one sample of 12.9 mg/kg (9.3 mg/kg Aroclor 1254 and 3.6 mg/kg Aroclor 1260).  



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 4 

 

   

 

 

This concentration constituted an Imminent Hazard (IH) condition under the MCP [310 CMR 

40.0321(2)(b)] since: 

 

 The total PCB concentration was equal to or greater than 10 mg/kg; 

 The sample was collected within 12 inches of the ground surface, and 

 In this case, the sample location was located within 500 feet of a residential dwelling and 

access to this location was not controlled or prevented at the time of sample collection. 

 

On behalf of and with approval from The Kelly Company, Inc., Mr. Joseph Jammallo of CJW 

reported the IH condition to Mr. Dino Dellechiaie of the MA DEP on August 16, 2016.  MA DEP 

assigned Release Tracking Number 2-19956 to this matter and orally approved the 

removal/excavation of up to 25 cubic yards of impacted soil under an IRA (310 CMR 

40.0410).  MA DEP further required fencing around this impacted area so that children could not 

access this area.  CJW erected 6-foot high chain-link fencing around the transformer area such that 

the IH condition was negated. 

 

1.2.3 Submittals and Receipts of Regulatory Documents 

The initial Notification and Self-Implementing Procedure Plan and Immediate Response Action 

Plan, dated October 5, 2016 was submitted to the USEPA on behalf of The Kelly Company, Inc.  

It was also submitted to MA DEP on October 7, 2016, via eDEP, to satisfy the submittal of an IRA 

Plan in accordance with 310 CMR 40.0420(7)(a). 

 

In a letter dated October 24, 2016 (Appendix A), the USEPA issued comments and questions to 

CJW’s October 5, 2016 report.  To address USEPA’s comments and questions, CJW prepared a 

Revised Self-Implementing Procedure Plan and Immediate Response Action Plan, dated October 

26, 2016, and submitted the document, along with an associated letter (Appendix A).  This revised 

document was also submitted to MA DEP via eDEP on November 11, 2016. 

 

In a letter dated November 7, 2016 (Appendix A), the USEPA provided its approval for the cleanup 

and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) remediation waste (e.g. concrete pads and soil). 

 

An Immediate Response Action Status Report #1, dated December 16, 2016, was submitted to MA 

DEP, via eDEP, on December 16, 2016.

2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION 

 

2.1 Site Location 

A Locus Map of the site is included as Figure 1.  Figure 2 is an aerial view depicting the site and 

surrounding area.  Figure 3 is the MA DEP Phase I Site Assessment Map obtained from 

Massachusetts Geographical Information System (Mass GIS).   

 

The attached Figure 4 – Site Plan depicts the following: 

 

 The layout of the current site and pertinent site features; 

 The approximate location of the pad-mounted transformer and the vacant concrete pad;  

 The approximate location of soil samples; and 

 Locations of other relevant site features. 

 

The attached Figure 5 – Monitoring Well Location Plan depicts the location of existing monitoring 

wells located in the proximity of PCB project area, the location of all transformers located on the site 

property, and other relevant site features. 

 

The release area is located exterior to and west of the 179 Brook Street manufacturing building, 

which is located within in a mixed commercial/industrial/residential area of Clinton, 

Massachusetts.  The latitude and longitude coordinates of the site are approximately 42° 25’ 25.59” 

north and 71° 41’ 31.23” west, respectively.  The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) 

coordinates of the site are Zone 19T, 4700338.26mN by 278532.92mE.  The approximate surface 

elevation at the site is 293 feet above mean sea level. 

 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 6 

 

   

 

 

According to the MA DEP Phase I Site Assessment Map provided in Figure 3, the site is not 

located within a Current or Potential Drinking Water Source Area as described in Section 4.0. No 

private drinking water supply wells are known to be located within 500 feet of the site.  The site 

is located within an area designated as a high yield Non Potential Drinking Water Source Area 

(NPDWSA), and areas designated as high and medium yield NPDWSA are located within 500 

feet of the site in all directions and within ½ mile of the site to the north and south, respectively.  

An area designated as protected open space is located within ½ mile of the site to the south.  No 

areas identified as Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) wetland habitat 

are located within ½ mile of the site.  Areas designated as freshwater wetlands are located within 

½ mile of the site to the southwest and northeast, respectively.  The closest surface water body is 

unnamed stream located within 500 feet east of the site, and Mossy Pond is located approximately 

½ mile of the site to the southwest.  Areas designated as Federal Emergency Management Agency 

(FEMA) 100 year flood plains are located within ½ mile of the site to the northeast associated with 

the aforementioned wetland areas.  No other environmental receptors are known to exist within 

500 feet of the site. 

 

The previously fenced area within which the pad-mounted transformer and impacted soil were 

located, and to which this SIP Plan applies, is not an area that is frequented by site employees or 

visitors.  This area would only likely be access to perform maintenance on the transformer or 

appurtenances such as underground or overhead electrical lines.  Therefore, this area meets the 

definition of a “Low Occupancy Area” as defined at 40 CFR 761.3 as it is an area where occupancy 

for an individual is less than 840 hours in a calendar year.   

 

2.2 Site Description 

The site consists of an irregularly shaped parcel of land fronting on Brook Street, which extends 

to Lawrence Street to the north associated with the access-roadway, and Marshall Street to the east 

associated with the eastern warehouse portion of the site building (Figure 2).  It is identified by the 

Town of Clinton Assessors’ Office as Map No. 81, Lot No. 498, containing approximately 2.27 

acres of land (98881.2 square feet).  It is further described in Quitclaim Deed (Book 23348, Page 

103) recorded in the Worcester County Registry of Deeds.  Exterior grade slopes gently toward 

the south on the south side of the site building, and more drastically to the south on the northern 

side of the site building, towards the topographic depression associated with the loading dock on 

the north side of the site building. 

 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 7 

 

   

 

 

The property is improved with one (1) single story manufacturing building covering approximately 

64,497 square feet, which is currently utilized by QEP, Inc. as a plastics manufacturing facility. 

The site building contains an office/reception area, multiple manufacturing areas, multiple 

warehouse areas, a waste storage area, a loading dock and a maintenance/machine shop.  The 

majority of the site building is constructed of concrete masonry unit (CMU) block, with a 

warehouse portion steel siding over wood framing, and is set upon a poured concrete foundation.  

According to the Assessor’s Cards for the property, the site building was constructed in 1949 to 

1950. 

 

A pad-mounted transformer (installed at the same location following the completion of the 

response actions discussed herein and following the removal of the PCB containing transformer) 

is currently located just west of the portion of the building at the site that fronts along Brook Street 

(Figure 4).   

 

Three additional transformers (pole-mount type) are currently active and staged on a raised 

wooden platform which spans between two utility poles, located approximately 92 feet to the north 

of the PCB containing/TSCA regulated pad-mounted transformer (Figure 5).  No other active or 

inactive oil filled transformers are known to be located at the site, as the only electrical service to 

the building enters from the southwestern corner of the site building adjacent to the pad-mounted 

transformer and continues, via overhead wires, to the platform containing the three pole-mounted 

transformers, and subsequently enters the northwestern portion of the site building thereafter. 

 

2.2 Surrounding Area 

The site is located in a mixed commercial/industrial/residential area on the north side of Brook 

Street in Clinton, Massachusetts.  The following properties/features surround the site (Figure 2): 

 

 To the north:  commercial properties (including R. Bates and Sons Sand and Gravel) and 

Lawrence Street, beyond which are multiple commercial and residential properties. 

 To the south:  three (3) residential properties, a retail gasoline station located at 203 Brook 

Street, and Brook Street, beyond which are residential properties (including a housing 

development), and a dry cleaners located at the intersection of Brook Street and 

Washington Street.  

 To the east:  residential and commercial properties, and Marshall Street, beyond which are 

commercial and residential properties, and another retail gasoline station located at 219 

Brook Street (Mr. G’s Gulf). 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 8 

 

   

 

 

 To the west:  multiple residential properties, beyond which is Greeley Street and additional 

residential properties. 

 

3.0 USE, SOURCE AND IDENTIFICATION OF PCBS AT THE SITE 

 

3.1 Use and Source(s) of PCBs 

There is no known or documented use of PCBs at the site other than what has been described in 

the former exterior pad-mounted transformer and potential transformers that may have previously 

occupied the former vacant concrete pad located just to the south of the existing pad-mounted 

transformer (Figure 4).  The source(s) of the PCBs identified in soil in the vicinity of the current 

pad-mounted transformer may likely be the former PCB containing transformer itself and/or one 

or more transformers that may have formerly occupied the vacant concrete pad.  However, the 

manner by which PCBs have come to be located in the soil in this area is unknown since there is 

no known record of a release or releases of oil from the existing pad-mounted transformer or other 

transformers which may have been located at the site. 

 

3.2 Identification of PCBs at the Site 

PCBs were initially identified from May 18, 2016 soil sample that abuts the pad-mounted 

transformer located just west of the portion of the building at the site that fronts along Brook Street.  

The sample was submitted to a laboratory for analysis of PCBs.  The testing results identified two 

PCBs in the sample:  Aroclor 1254 in a concentration of 1.6 mg/kg and Aroclor 1260 in a 

concentration of 0.77 mg/kg.  Subsequent sampling and testing of an oil sample from the pad-

mounted transformer revealed it contained PCBs, specifically Aroclor 1260, in a concentration of 

110 mg/kg.  Further sampling and testing of soil in the vicinity of the transformer is described in 

Section 5.0. 

 

Additional soil sampling and testing revealed a total PCB concentration in one sample of 12.9 

mg/kg.  This concentration constituted an IH condition under the MCP [310 CMR 40.0321(2)(b)] 

since: 

 

 The total PCB concentration was equal to or greater than 10 mg/kg; 

 The sample was collected within 12 inches of the ground surface, and 

 In this case, the sample location was located within 500 feet of a residential dwelling and 

access to this location is not presently controlled or prevented.

3.3 Initial Mitigation Measures 

On behalf of The Kelly Company, Inc., CJW reported the above condition to the MA DEP on 

August 16, 2016.  MA DEP assigned Release Tracking Number 2-19956 to this matter and orally 

approved the removal/excavation of up to 25 cubic yards of impacted soil under an IRA 310 CMR 

40.0410.  MA DEP further required fencing around this impacted area so that children could not 

access it.  CJW erected a 6-foot high chain link fence around the transformer and the known 

impacted area of soil which negated the IH condition. 

 

4.0 MCP RISK CHARACTERIZATION CATEGORIES FOR SOIL AND 

GROUNDWATER 

 

The MCP establishes categories of groundwater and soil for use in the characterization of risk 

posed by contamination at a site. When considering the use of Method 1 and Method 2 risk 

characterizations, it is necessary to categorize these media.  When Method 3 is used to characterize 

risk, the groundwater categories are used to identify applicable or suitably analogous standards. 

 

The MCP identifies three types of applicable groundwater categories: GW-1, GW-2, and GW-3.  

One or more groundwater categories may apply at a given site.  Groundwater category GW-1 is 

defined as a Current Drinking Water Source Area or a Potential Drinking Water Source Area as 

defined below:   

 

A Current Drinking Water Source Area is defined as groundwater located: 

 

 within a Zone II of a public water supply; 

 within an Interim Well Head Protection Area (IWPA) of a public water supply; 

 within the Zone A of a Class A surface water body used for a public water supply; or 

 within 500 feet of a private drinking water supply well. 

 

A Potential Drinking Water Source Area is defined as groundwater located: 

 

 within 500 feet or more from a public water system distribution pipeline; unless the 

groundwater is located under a parcel of land or a facility where any portion of that parcel 

of land or facility is located less than 500 feet from a public water supply distribution 

pipeline; 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 10 

 

   

 

 

 within an area designated by a municipality specifically for the protection of groundwater 

quality to ensure its availability for use as a source of potable water supply; and 

 within a Potentially Productive Aquifer (PPA) that has not been excluded as a NPDWSA. 

 

Groundwater is classified GW-2 when it is located within 30 feet of a planned or existing occupied 

building or structure, and the average annual depth to groundwater in the area is 15 feet or less.  

Groundwater in this category could serve as a source of volatile contaminants to indoor air.  

 

Groundwater category GW-3 applies to all groundwater in the Commonwealth based upon 

discharge to surface water because it is deemed that all groundwater ultimately discharges to a 

surface water body. 

 

The site is not located within a Current or Potential Drinking Water Source Area, therefore, 

groundwater category GW-1 does not apply.  The site is located within 30 feet of an occupied 

structure (i.e. the manufacturing building).  One (1) monitoring well (designated CJW-1) was 

installed through the base of the completed excavation area prior to backfilling of the excavation 

area (Section 6.6.4) (Figure 5).  The depth to water in CJW-1 was recorded to be located 

approximately 3.05 feet below the ground surface (monitoring well CJW-1 was not surveyed into 

the existing well matrix for the entire site; however, CJW-1 was completed to the approximate 

elevation of the surrounding ground surface) during the groundwater sampling activities conducted 

on December 8, 2016 (refer to Table 2 – Summary of Groundwater Gauging Data).  Therefore, 

under the MCP groundwater category GW-2 applies to this portion of the site.  Further, category 

GW-3 applies as this category applies to all groundwater in the Commonwealth.  Therefore, the 

MCP risk characterization categories for groundwater at the site are GW-2/GW-3. 

 

The categorization of soils is based on the potential for exposure, considering both the current and 

reasonably foreseeable site activities and uses.  There are three soil categories: S-1, S-2, and S-3.  

Category S-1 is associated with the highest potential for exposure, and category S-3 the lowest 

potential for exposure.  Several factors are considered when categorizing the soils at the site.  These 

include the type of receptor present at a site, the frequency of use, the intensity of use, and the 

accessibility of the soil. 

 

For risk characterization purposes, soils at the disposal site may be classified as S-1, S-2, and S-3.  

It is likely that one or more of these soil classifications exist for this site.  Soil is classified as S-1 

if either: 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 11 

 

   

 

 

 

 The soil is “accessible” (zero to 3 feet and unpaved) and either the soil is currently used 

for growing fruits or vegetables for human consumption or it is reasonably foreseeable that 

the soil may be put to such use; or a child’s frequency or intensity of use is considered high 

and/or an adult’s frequency and intensity of use are both considered to be high; or  

 The soil is “potentially accessible” (3 feet to 15 feet and unpaved or zero to 15 feet and 

paved) and a child’s frequency or intensity of use is considered to be high. 

 

Soil is classified as S-2 if either: 

 

 The soil is “accessible” and a child’s frequency and intensity of use are considered low or 

children are not present at the disposal site and either (but not both) the adult’s frequency 

or intensity of use is considered to be high; or 

 The soil is “potentially accessible” and either (but not both) a child’s frequency or intensity 

of use is considered to be high or children are not present at the disposal site and an adult’s 

frequency and intensity of use are both considered to be high. 

 

Soil is classified as S-3 if either: 

 

 The soil is “accessible” and children are not present at the disposal site and an adult’s  

frequency and intensity of use are both considered low; or 

 The soil is “potentially accessible” and a child’s frequency or intensity of use are both 

considered to be low; or a demonstration has been made that children are not present at the 

disposal site, and an adult’s frequency and intensity of use are both considered to be low; 

or 

 The soil is isolated (greater than 15 feet or under the footprint of a building or permanent 

structure), regardless of any receptor’s frequency or intensity of use. 

 

Receptor characteristics are that children could be present at a high frequency since the site is 

abutted by residential property; intensity of use is low; and the soil is considered to be accessible 

(0 to 3 feet below grade).  Although the applicable category for soil that is located beneath the pad 

that supported the former transformer and the pad that supports the new transformer would be S-

3, we have conservatively used an applicable soil category of S-1 for all soil at the site located 

between 0 feet to 3 feet below grade.  Soil category S-1 would further apply when considering the 

potential applicability of an Activity and Use Limitation (AUL). 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 12 

 

   

 

 

 

Ultimately, the soil categories are combined with the groundwater categories.  Therefore, for this 

disposal site, the applicable Method 1 soil categories would be S-1/GW-2/GW-3 with S-1/GW-

2/GW-3 being further used for consideration of an AUL under the MCP.  For each of these 

combinations, the S-1 soil standard is 1 mg/kg (or 1 ppm). 

 

5.0 ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES 

 

The following sections discuss the various assessment activities that were conducted prior to 

implementing cleanup activities and included sampling and laboratory testing of the transformer 

oil, soil, and concrete pads.  All samples were submitted under chain-of-custody to Con-Test 

Analytical Laboratory of E. Longmeadow, Massachusetts (Con-Test) for analysis.  Figure 4 

displays the locations of the concrete pads and soil samples discussed herein.  Figure 5 displays 

the monitoring wells at the site. 

 

5.1 Transformer Oil Sample 

On July 19, 2016, CJW collected a discrete sample of the oil from the transformer and submitted 

it to Con-Test for analysis of PCBs by SW-846, Method 600/4-81-045.  The testing results, 

presented in Appendix B, identified the oil as containing Aroclor 1260 in a concentration of 110 

mg/kg. 

 

5.2 Concrete Pad Sampling and Testing 

On August 19, 2016, CJW collected three (3) concrete samples from each of the two (2) concrete 

pads in the area where PCBs were identified in site soils in accordance with the Standard Operating 

Procedure for Sampling Porous Surfaces for PCBs (May 2011).  Samples 1A, 1B, and 1C were 

collected from the pad that houses the transformer and samples 2A, 2B, and 2C were collected 

from the vacant pad (Figure 4).  Each sample was collected by using a hammer drill to scour the 

surface of the pad to a depth of approximately 0.5 inch to obtain concrete dust/chips which were 

placed into sampling containers.  The original document provided to US EPA indicated that the 

sampling depth interval was 1-inch.  However, upon reviewing the field notes and scope of work 

for CJW’s field technician who conducted the sampling, CJW confirmed that the sampling depth 

interval was 0.5 inch, as specified by the USEAP in its Standard Operating Procedure for Sampling 

Porous Surfaces for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (USEPA, May 2011)..  As three (3) samples were 

collected for each type of porous surface [i.e. each of the two (2) transformer pads], samples were 

collected at a frequency greater than one (1) sample per 100 square feet [six (6)samples were 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 13 

 

   

 

 

submitted for approximately 70 square feet of concrete], and suspected stained area(s) were 

sampled (as staining was uniform and heavily weathered across both concrete pads), CJW 

concludes that the concrete sampling and testing was adequate to define PCB concentrations for 

off-site disposal. 

 

The samples were submitted to Con-Test for analysis of PCBs by SW-846, Method 8082 using 

soxhlet extraction (Method 3540C).  The laboratory testing results, presented in Appendix C, 

reveal the following: 

 

Sample ID PCB Concentration (mg/kg) 

1A No PCBs were identified at or above the 

laboratory’s RL* of 0.096 mg/kg 

1B No PCBs were identified at or above the 

laboratory’s RL* of 0.075 mg/kg 

1C Aroclor 1254 at 0.18 mg/kg 

2A Aroclor 1248 at 0.18 mg/kg 

DUP (duplicate of 2A) Aroclor 1248 at 0.14 mg/kg 

2B No PCBs were identified at or above the 

laboratory’s RL* of 0.090 mg/kg 

2C Aroclor 1248 at 0.14 mg/kg 

Note:  * RL = Laboratory Reporting Limit 

 

5.3 Soil Sampling and Testing 

Soil samples were collected as either composite samples or discrete (grab).  Composite samples 

were initially collected in May 2016 (Section 5.3.1) as part of an ASTM Phase II Environmental 

Site Assessment (ESA) that was performed at the site.  A composite sample is a mixture of more 

than one sample collected from certain locations at the same depth or depth range.  The individual 

samples were then thoroughly mixed in a stainless steel bowl with a stainless steel mixing device 

and the composite sample was then collected from this mixture.  All subsequent samples, as 

described herein, consisted of discrete or grab samples collected at a specific location and depth. 

 

One or more subsequent sections discuss the collection of surface soil samples.  Under 40 CFR 

Part 761, soil samples generally are required to be collected from the soil surface (top 0 to 3 

inches).  In addition, this sampling interval is also specified under 40 CFR 761, Subparts O and N.  

CJW did indeed collected surface samples from 0 to 6 inches.  However, what the original SIP 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 14 

 

   

 

 

Plan failed to note was that the first 3 inches consisted of organic matter including leaves, pine 

needles and root matter.  Therefore, although these soil samples were collected from 3 to 6 inches 

from ground surface, they were technically collected from the top 3 inches of soil. 

 

5.3.1 Initial Soil Sampling and Testing 

On May 18, 2016 as part of an ASTM Phase II ESA, CJW collected two soil samples at the site 

within 6-inches of the ground surface.  One sample, labeled as “Pad Mount Transformer” was a 

composite sample made up of soil collected adjacent to the four sides of the existing pad-mounted 

transformer pad within 6-inches of the ground surface.  The second sample, labeled as “Pole Mount 

Transformer”, was also a composite sample made up of three soil samples collected directly 

beneath the three transformers attached to the existing utility pole which is located approximately 

8 feet north of the pad-mounted transformer (Figure 4).  The samples were submitted to Con-Test 

for analysis of PCBs by SW-846, Method 8082 using microwave extraction (Method 3546) and 

extractable petroleum hydrocarbon (EPH) carbon fractions and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon 

(PAH) target analytes in accordance with MA DEP methodology. 

 

As these two (2) composite soil samples were collected as part of ASTM Phase II ESA activities 

conducted at the site, and prior to the sampling of MODF (July 19, 2016) from the pad-mounted 

transformer which triggered TSCA 40 CFR Part 761, the sampling and testing results discussed in 

this Section were not intended to meet the requirements under 40 CFR Part 761, and should not be 

considered to support disposal of the noted soil as a <50 ppm PCB waste (as compositing of 

samples for characterization and/or to confirm PCB concentrations are <50 ppm is not authorized 

by USEPA).  Please refer to Sections 5.3.2, 5.3.3 and 5.3.4 for discussion of discrete soil sampling 

performed under the requirements of 40 CFR Part 761 to support disposal as a < 50 ppm PCB 

waste in accordance with 40 CFR 761.61(a)(5)(i)(B)(2)(ii). 

 

The testing results, presented in Appendix D and summarized in Table 1, reveal that PCBs were 

identified in both samples.  Sample “Pad Mount Transformer” contained a total of 2.37 mg/kg 

PCBs (1.6 mg/kg Aroclor 1254 and 0.77 mg/kg Aroclor 1260).  Sample “Pole Mount Transformer” 

contained Aroclor 1260 in a concentration of 0.14 mg/kg.  These concentrations are less than the 

Method 1, S-3/GW-2/GW-3 standard of 4 mg/kg but above the S-1/GW-2/GW-3 standard of 1 

mg/kg. 

 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 15 

 

   

 

 

For the EPH testing results, carbon fractions and PAH target analytes were identified in both 

samples, however, the concentrations were less that the applicable S-3/GW-2/GW-3 standards and 

the S-1/GW-2/GW-3 standard.   

 

5.3.2 Subsequent Soil Sampling, August 9, 2016 

CJW collected 12 discrete soil samples on August 9, 2016 in the immediate vicinity of the pad-

mounted transformer.  The sample locations are shown on Figure 4.  Samples depths ranged as 

follows: 

 

Sample ID Approx. Depth Range (inches below grade) 

S-1 0-6 

S-1 6-12 

S-1 12-18 

S-2 0-6 

S-2 6-12 

S-3 0-6 

S-3 6-12 

S-4 0-6 

S-4 6-12 

S-5 0-6 

S-6 0-6 

S-7 0-6 

 

The samples were submitted to Con-Test for analysis of PCBs by SW-846, Method 8082 using 

soxhlet extraction (Method 3540C).  The laboratory testing results, presented in Appendix D and 

summarized in Table 1, reveal the following: 

 

 One or more PCBs (Aroclor 1254 and/or Aroclor 1260) were identified in 10 of the 12 

samples.  Samples S-2 (6”-12”) and S-4 (6”-12”) were not identified as containing PCBs 

at concentrations equal to or in excess of the laboratory’s RL of 0.1 mg/kg. 

 Of the samples identified as containing PCBs, 3 samples [S-1 (0”-6”); S-1 (6”-12”); and 

S-7 (0”-6”)] were identified as containing PCBs with total concentrations in excess of the 

S-1/GW-2/GW-3 standard. 

 Soil was identified as containing PCBs up to 18 inches below grade. 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 16 

 

   

 

 

 Sample S-1 (0”-6”) contained a total PCB concentration of 12.9 mg/kg.  As previously 

discussed, this soil sample triggered the 2-hour reporting condition to MA DEP as an IH. 

 

Access to subsurface soils has been limited in the PCB impacted area since the pad-mounted 

transformer and associated underground electrical conduits had been energized throughout the 

duration of the assessment activities discussed herein, as the manufacturing facility tenant had 

been operating continuously (24 hours a day, 7 days a week).  As such, CJW was unable, due to 

electrical safety concerns, to conduct any subsurface sampling activates at depths exceeding those 

discussed herein, which did not exceed 18 inches below the ground surface.  However, based on 

the following data, it appeared that the PCB concentrations were attenuating relative to the sample 

depth(s) as observed at the following sampling locations: 

 

 S-1 [12.9 mg/kg PCBs at the surface to 1.96 mg/kg PCBs from 12-18” below ground 

surface (bgs)]; 

 S-2 (0.26 mg/kg PCBs at the surface to non-detected at 6-12” bgs); 

 S-3 (0.25 mg/kg PCBs at the surface to 0.24 mg/kg PCBs at 6-12” bgs); and  

 S-4 (0.85 mg/kg PCBs at the surface to non-detected at 6-12” bgs), 

 

Following the completion of the assessment activities discussed herein, CJW determined that PCB 

concentrations in soil greater than 1 mg/kg were not anticipated to be encountered at depths 

exceeding 2 to 3 feet bgs. 

 

5.3.3 Soil Sampling, August 19, 2016 

Soil sampling from this date forward in the vicinity of the concrete pads was guided by 40 CFR 

761, Subpart N, Cleanup Site Characterization Sampling for PCB Remediation Waste in 

Accordance with 761.61(a)(2).  Subpart N specifies a sampling grid interval of 3 meters 

(approximately 9.84 feet).  Soil samples discussed in this Section were collected using a maximum 

grid interval of approximately 10 feet as seen on Figure 4.  More specifically, sample spacing 

ranged from approximately 5.7 (e.g. between samples S-13 and S-23) to approximately 10 feet 

(e.g. between samples S-12 and S-14; and S-11 and S-13).  However, initial assessment soil 

samples collected in the immediately vicinity of the pad-mounted transformer (e.g. samples S-5, 

S-2 and S-6, S-3 and S-3, S-10 and S-10, S-4 and S-4, S-7, S-9) were done so at closer intervals 

in an effort to confirm the likely source of the PCB release (Section 5.3.2).   

 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 17 

 

   

 

 

CJW collected a total of 7 samples (S-8 through S-14, inclusive) plus one duplicate (labeled as 

DUP; duplicated of S-8) from approximately 0”-6” below grade sample on August 19, 2016.  The 

sample locations are shown on Figure 4. 

 

The samples were submitted to Con-Test for analysis of PCBs by SW-846, Method 8082 using 

soxhlet extraction (Method 3540C).  The laboratory testing results, presented in Appendix D and 

summarized in Table 1, reveal the following: 

 

 Each sample and the duplicate contained two PCBs (Aroclor 1254 and Aroclor 1260.  

Samples S-12 (0”-6”) and S-14 (0”-6”) also contained Aroclor 1248.  Concentrations of 

individual PCBs ranged from 0.19 mg/kg (Aroclor 1260 in S-9) to 8.7 mg/kg (Aroclor 1248 

in S-12).  The highest total PCB concentration of 12.7 mg/kg was identified in S-12 (0”-

6”). 

 Six of the samples plus the duplicate were identified as containing PCBs with total 

concentrations in excess of the S-1/GW-2/GW-3 standard.  Only sample S-9 contained 

individual PCBs and a total PCB concentration less than the S-1/GW-2/GW-3 standard. 

 

5.3.4 Soil Sampling, September 1, 2016 

CJW collected a total of 9 discrete soil samples (S-15 through S-23, inclusive) from approximately 

0”-6” below grade sample on September 1, 2016.  The sample locations are shown on Figure 4. 

 

The samples were submitted to Con-Test for analysis of PCBs by SW-846, Method 8082 using 

soxhlet extraction (Method 3540C).  The laboratory testing results, presented in Appendix D and 

summarized in Table 1, reveal the following: 

 

 Each sample contained Aroclor 1254.  Four samples (S-15, S-16, S-22, and S-23) also 

contained Aroclor 1260.  Sample S-22 contained a third PCB (Aroclor 1248). 

 S-15 was identified as containing individual PCBs greater than the S-1/GW-2/GW-3 

standard.  The total PCB concentration in this sample was greater than the S-1/GW-2/GW-

3 standard. 

 

5.4 Distribution of PCB Identified 

Assessment activities conducted to date have identified concentrations of PCBs in near-surface 

soil (up to 18-inches below grade) in the vicinity of the pad-mounted transformer in concentrations 

ranging up to 9.3 mg/kg for an individual PCB (Aroclor 1254) to 12.9 mg/kg total PCBs.  Both of 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 18 

 

   

 

 

these concentrations are associated with sample S-1 (0”-6”).  The lateral distribution of total PCB 

concentration in any given sample prior to remediation is shown on Figure 4 by way of color 

coding.   

 

5.5 Conceptual Site Model 

One of the elements that should be evaluated in a Representativeness Evaluation in support of a 

Permanent Solution, pursuant to 310 CMR 40.1056(2)(k), is a Conceptual Site Model (CSM).  The 

CSM is a site-specific description of what and how contaminants entered the environment, how 

they were transported within the system, and routes of exposure to and identification of human 

and environmental receptors.  It provides a framework for assessing risks from contaminants, 

controlling or eliminating sources, developing response action strategies, and determining whether 

those strategies have been effective in achieving the requirements of the Permanent Solution.  The 

CSM should be modified as necessary to incorporate new information and guide decision-making 

throughout the site assessment, risk characterization, and remediation of the disposal site.  Its 

complexity is directly related to the complexity of disposal site conditions. 

 

Components of a CSM include: 

 

 History of the disposal site as applicable to the potential presence of oil and hazardous 

materials; 

 Geologic and hydrogeological setting; 

 Description of known/likely source(s) and types of contaminants 

 Description of the known/estimated volume/mass of contaminant(s) released; 

 The approximate date/time period of the release(s); 

 The location(s) of the release(s) and affected media and horizontal and vertical extent of 

the contamination; 

 Description of contaminant fate and transport in the environment, including migration 

pathways and rates, density and hydrodynamic factors, and contaminant degradation rates 

and degradation products; and 

 Mechanisms/pathways and points of exposure by human and ecological receptors 

 

There is no known or documented use of PCBs at the site other than what has been described in 

the former exterior pad-mounted transformer and potential transformers that may have previously 

occupied the former vacant concrete pad located just to the south of the existing pad-mounted 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 19 

 

   

 

 

transformer (Figure 4).  The source(s) of the PCBs identified in soil in the vicinity of the current 

pad-mounted transformer may likely have been the former PCB containing transformer itself 

and/or one or more transformers that may have formerly occupied the vacant concrete pad.  

However, the manner by which PCBs have come to be located in the soil in this area is unknown 

since there is no known record of a release or releases of oil from the existing pad-mounted 

transformer or other transformers which may have been located at the site. 

 

Three additional transformers (pole-mount type) are currently active and staged on a raised 

wooden platform which spans between two utility poles, located approximately 92 feet to the north 

of the PCB containing/TSCA regulated pad-mounted transformer (Figure 5).  No other active or 

inactive oil filled transformers are known to be located at the site, as the only electrical service to 

the building enters from the southwestern corner of the site building adjacent to the pad-mounted 

transformer and continues, via overhead wires, to the platform containing the three pole-mounted 

transformers, and subsequently enters the northwestern portion of the site building thereafter. 

 

The manner in which the PCBs were released is unknown and the volume/mass of PCBs released 

in this area is unknown.  However, the volume/mass of PCBs released appears to have been minor 

based on the lateral distribution of PCBs, impacting the concrete pads and soil located within the 

immediate vicinity of the pads.  Further, the relatively limited horizontal and vertical distribution 

of PCBs identified in soil in the vicinity of the transformers would suggest that the soil had not 

been disturbed since the original release or releases occurred since soil disturbance would have 

likely resulted in PCB-impacted soil that was distributed over a larger area and likely to greater 

depths.   

 

According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), PCBs in general 

are relatively insoluble in water, and the solubility decreases with increased chlorination (see Table 

4-3).  The primary PCBs identified at this site include Aroclor 1254 and 1260.  ATSDR also states 

that PCBs are soluble in nonpolar organic solvents (i.e., hydrocarbons such as gasoline) and 

biological lipids.  According to information prepared by the Oregon Department of Environmental 

Quality, PCBs are nonpolar and therefore are only slightly soluble.  This characteristic inhibits the 

transport of PCBs from soil to water (groundwater or surface water) and makes them bind strongly 

to soils.  The fact that PCBs were not identified in groundwater from the monitoring well placed 

within the excavation area is likely due to the fact that PCBs are relative insoluble and no nonpolar 

organic solvents were identified within the vicinity of where PCBs were found to be present in soil 

at the site. 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 20 

 

   

 

 

 

PCBs can be transported to surface water via entrainment of contaminated soil particles in surface 

water runoff.  In water, a small portion of PCBs will dissolve, but the majority will bind to organic 

particles and bottom sediments.  Although PCBs have a strong affinity for sediment, small amounts 

of PCBs are released from sediments to water over time.  Once in the water, PCBs are also taken 

up by small organisms and fish. PCBs accumulate in the fatty tissue of these organisms.  PCBs 

have a relatively low vapor pressure.  Despite their low volatility, PCBs do volatilize from both soil 

and water. 

 

PCBs tend to build up in living organisms both by uptake from the environment over time 

(bioaccumulation) and along the food chain (biomagnification).  PCBs remain stored in fatty 

tissues much more than in muscles or other body parts. 

 

ATSDR notes that routes of exposure for humans are inhalation, oral, and dermal.  Although PCBs 

are readily absorbed into the body, they are slowly metabolized and excreted.  PCBs initially 

distribute preferentially to the liver and muscle tissue. 

 

6.0 PCB REMEDIATION 

 

6.1 Objectives 

6.1.1 TSCA Objectives 

The intent of the SIP Plan was to perform cleanup of the impacted soil to meet the minimum 

requirement under 40 CFR 761.61(a)(4)(i)(B) for Low Occupancy Areas of less than or equal to 

25 parts per million (ppm).  However, the overall goal was to perform cleanup such that the 

concentrations of PCBs in soil and concrete remaining at the site were less than 1 mg/kg so that a 

deed notice was not required  per 40 CFR 761.61(a)(8).   

 

6.1.2 MCP Objectives 

The objectives of the IRA Plan were to: 1) assess the vertical and horizontal extent of PCBs in 

soil; 2) remove PCB-impacted from the site to meet MCP requirements; 3) assess the need to assess 

groundwater quality; 4) stabilize site conditions as necessary; and 5) assess site conditions during 

and at the completion of response activities to determine the need to conduct further response 

actions.

CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 21 

 

   

 

 

The minimum goal of the IRA activities was the demonstrated reduction of PCB concentrations in 

site soil to levels below the applicable risk characterization standard for soil categories S-3/GW-

2/GW-3 of 4 mg/kg.  However, such a cleanup goal would require the implementation of an AUL.  

Therefore, similar to the goal stated in Section 6.1.1 above, the overall goal under the MCP was to 

perform cleanup such that the concentrations of PCBs in soil remaining at the site are less than 1 

mg/kg S-1/GW-2/GW-3 risk characterization standard so that an AUL was not necessary. 

 

6.2 Laboratory Analytical Procedures 

In accordance with 40 CFR 761.272, all soil and concrete samples were submitted to Con-Test for 

analysis of PCBs by SW-846, Method 8082 using soxhlet extraction (Method 3540C).  A duplicate 

sample was submitted at a frequency on one per twenty samples. 

 

6.3 Health and Safety Activities 

Prior to the beginning of each day work activities at the site, a meeting was held with the on-site 

workers to apprise them of the health and safety concerns and procedures, as described in the 

Work Plan, Health and Safety Plan and Equipment Decontamination Plan that was prepared for 

this project and to respond to any questions that arose. 

 

6.4 PCB Cleanup and Associated Activities – December 5 and 6, 2016 

On December 5, 2016, CJW removed the chain-link fencing that was in-place around the impacted 

soil and concrete pads to facilitate access to the immediate site area for cleanup and other activities.  

Initially, the pad-mounted transformer and associated electrical equipment were de-energized.  

Upon arrival at the site, New England Disposal Technologies, Inc. (NEDT) of Sutton, 

Massachusetts set up operations such that lined roll-off containers were staged north of Brook 

Street and 6-mil polyethylene sheeting was placed on the ground surface in the area between Brook 

Street, the roll-off containers and the Support zone.  The impacted concrete pads were removed 

and the soil was excavated with a track-mounted backhoe which was stationed in or outside of the 

Support Zone.  As the concrete and soil was removed/excavated, it was placed in a skid-steer 

loader that remained in or outside of the Support Zone and the skid-steer moved along the 

polyethylene sheeting to empty its loads into the lined roll-off containers. 

 

On December 5, 2016, NEDT utilized jack hammers to break the concrete pad closest to Brook 

Street into manageable pieces which were placed in skid-steer loader and then the roll-off 

containers.  Once this pad was removed, NEDT proceeded to excavate soil from below and 

surrounding this pad to a depth of approximately 2 to 3 feet below grade as noted on Figure 6. 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 22 

 

   

 

 

 

On December 6, 2016, the pad mounted transformer was wrapped in 6-mil polyethylene sheeting 

and then lifted off of the concrete pad with a crane and placed onto a secondary containment truck 

provided by TCI of NY, LLC (TCI).  The transformer was subsequently transported by TCI to the 

TCI of Alabama, LLC facility in Pell City, Alabama for disposal (US EPA Facility ID No. 

ALD983167891).  Subsequently, NEDT utilized jack hammers to break the associated concrete 

pad into manageable pieces which were placed in skid-steer loader and then the roll-off containers.  

Once this pad was removed, NEDT proceeded to excavate soil from below and surrounding this 

pad to a depth of approximately 2 to 3 feet below grade as noted on Figure 6. 

 

Refer to Photos 1 through 8 in the Photographic Log presented in Appendix I for photos of the 

additional excavation activities conducted on December 5 and 6, 2016. 

 

6.5 Electrical Power Restoration 

Since electrical power needed to be restored to the building as soon as possible, NEDT placed 

backfill within the area where the former transformer was located and compacted this soil.  One 

(1) new precast concrete pad was then placed atop of this backfill, a new transformer was placed 

onto the pad, electrical connections were made to the new transformer and the transformer was 

energized. 

 

6.6 Sampling and Testing of Media 

 

6.6.1 Verification Sampling Approach 

In accordance with 40 CFR 761.61(a)(6), sampling and testing of soil to verify the completion of 

SIP cleanup was performed in accordance with Subpart O.  As such, CJW establish a grid pattern 

[761.283(b)(1)(ii)(2) and (3)] where sampling points were approximately 1.5 meters (or 

approximately 5 feet) apart.  Figures 7 and 8 show the soil sample locations of the excavation and 

verification sample areas. 

 

Verification sampling of soil that remained in place subsequent to excavation was based on a grid 

pattern and dependent upon the depth of the excavation(s) at the time of and following the soil 

removal activities.  Grid locations representing the base of the excavation were obtained from the 

lowest point of the excavation, while grid locations representing the sidewalls of the excavation 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 23 

 

   

 

 

were obtained from a mid-point depth located below the existing surface grade and the base of the 

excavation at that location. 

 

A north/south oriented 5-foot by 5-foot grid pattern was overlain onto these areas shown on Figures 

7 and 8.  The intersection of each 5-foot by 5-foot grid or cell was assigned an alpha-numeric 

identification [consecutive letters (A, B, C, and D) along the X-axis and consecutive numbers (1 

through 9, inclusive).  A verification grab sample was collected from the intersection of each grid 

line at the base of the excavation once the excavation reached its final, proposed depth.  For 

example, a sample identified as B7 Bot 1’ would mean that the sample was collected at grid 

intersection “B” in the east-west direction, at grid intersection “7” in the north-south direction, and 

at the base “Bot” of the excavation at a depth of 1 foot below the original grade.  If additional and 

deeper excavations were necessary at a certain sampling location based on the testing results of 

the initial sample that was collected, the subsequent sample collected at a greater depth would be 

labeled as having been collected at a depth further below grade.  Soil samples which were over-

excavated (i.e., A9 North SW and B1 Bot) are shown highlighted in yellow on Table 1, as the 

concentrations are no longer representative of in-situ soil conditions. 

 

Soil samples were also collected from the north, south, and west sidewalls of the excavation along 

its perimeter at a depth representing the mid-point below the initial, existing grade and the depth 

of the excavation.  Such a sample would have a “SW” in the sample label.  For example, a sample 

identified as B6 North SW 1.25’ would mean that the sample was collected at grid intersection 

“B” on the North Sidewall, at a depth of 1.25 feet below the original grade.  If the excavation was 

initially deeper or subsequently proceeded deeper in certain abutting areas, the mid-point sidewall 

sample location then became the halfway point between the depth of the previous excavation and 

the depth of the new excavation.  Since the eastern sidewall of the excavation continued to and 

abutted the wall of the site building some concrete samples of the building foundation sidewall 

were also collected and analyzed. 

 

6.6.2 Soil Verification Sampling and Analysis and Further Soil Removal Activities  

On December 6, 2016, prior to NEDT placing backfill within the area where the former 

transformer was located to prepare for the placement of a new pad-mounted transformer, CJW 

collected a total of 20 grab or discrete soil samples from the base and sidewalls of the excavation.  

These samples were submitted to Con-Test for analysis of PCBs. 

 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 24 

 

   

 

 

All testing results, presented in Appendix D and summarized in Table 1, revealed PCB 

concentrations of less than 1 mg/kg except for samples A9 North SW ½’ (3.7 mg/kg PCB 1254), 

DUP-3 A9 North SW ½’ (5.6-mg/kg PCB 1254; 1.4 mg/kg PCB 1260), and B1 Bot 1’ (3 mg/kg 

PCB 1254).  These concentrations meet the minimum requirement under 40 CFR 

761.61(a)(4)(i)(B) for Low Occupancy Areas of less than or equal to 25 parts per million (ppm).  

However, since the overall goal was to perform cleanup such that the concentrations of PCBs in 

soil remaining at the site were less than 1 ppm [PCB concentrations greater than 1 ppm but less 

than or equal to 25 ppm remaining in soil at the site after cleanup would a deed notice in accordance 

with 40 CFR 761.61(a)(8)], CJW returned the site on December 15, 2016 to remove additional soil 

from these two sample locations in an effort to reduce the concentrations of PCBs in soil remaining 

at the site to less than 1 ppm. 

 

On December 15, 2016, an additional 1 foot of soil was removed from initial sample location A9 

North SW ½’ such that the excavation extended to the foundation of the building extension to the 

north, and an additional 12-inches of soil was removed from initial sample location B1 Bot 1’ 

(Figures 6 and 7).  Soil that was removed was placed into three (3) 55-gallon steel drums for 

disposal off site (Section 12.2). Refer to Photos 9 and 10 in the Photographic Log presented in 

Appendix I for photos of the additional excavation activities conducted on December 15, 2016. 

 

Additionally on December 15, 2016, CJW collected samples soil from these two (2) additional 

excavation areas/locations.  The identification of the samples was changed to reflect the new depth 

of the excavation at these locations such that initial sample location A9 North SW ½’ now became 

sample A9 North SW 0.75’ and initial sample location B1 Bot 1’ became B1 Bot 2’.  These samples 

were submitted to Con-Test for analysis of PCBs.  The testing results, presented in Appendix D 

and summarized in Table 1, reveal PCB concentrations of less than 1 mg/kg.  As such, the 

combined testing results of soil remaining in-place at the site now meet the minimum requirement 

under 40 CFR 761.61(a)(4)(i)(B) for Low Occupancy Areas of less than or equal to 25 parts per 

million (ppm) and the overall goal of less than 1 ppm such that a deed notice was not required per 

40 CFR 761.61(a)(8).  The testing results are also less than the MCP S-1/GW-2/GW-3 standard. 

 

6.6.3 Concrete Foundation Sampling and Analysis 

Since the eastern sidewall of the excavation continued up to and abutted the sidewall of the 

building foundation, CJW collected three concrete foundation samples (labeled Concrete-3, 

Concrete-4, and Concrete-5) on December 8, 2016 in accordance with the Standard Operating 

Procedure for Sampling Porous Surfaces for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (USEPA, May 2011).  The 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 25 

 

   

 

 

sample locations are shown on Figure 8.  It should be noted that in areas where the excavation area 

was completed flush to the concrete building foundation that the foundation extended to depths 

exceeding the depth of the excavation, such that no exposed were present underlying the 

foundation wall/ 

 

Each sample was collected by using a hammer drill to scour the surface of the pad to a depth of 

approximately 0.5 inch to obtain concrete dust/chips which were placed into sampling containers.  

The samples were submitted to Con-Test for analysis of PCBs by SW-846, Method 8082 using 

soxhlet extraction (Method 3540C).  The laboratory testing results, presented in Appendix C and 

summarized in Table 3, reveal the following: 

 

Sample ID PCB Concentration (mg/kg) 

Concrete-3 No PCBs were identified at or above the 

laboratory’s RL* of 0.091 mg/kg 

Concrete-4 Aroclor 1254 at 0.16 mg/kg (RL of 0.078 

mg/kg) 

Concrete-5 No PCBs were identified at or above the 

laboratory’s RL* of 0.092 mg/kg 

Note:  * RL = Laboratory Reporting Limit 

 

6.6.4 Groundwater Sampling and Analysis 

Subsequent to the excavation of the concrete pads and soil, a relatively thin layer of groundwater 

accumulated in a portion of the exaction located south of the concrete pad that supported the 

transformer.  To evaluate groundwater for PCB impact, CJW installed a 1-inch diameter polyvinyl 

chloride (PVC) pipe monitoring well at this location (Figures 7 and 8).  The well, labeled as CJW-

1, was installed by hand such that a 5-foot section of “screened” or machine-slotted portion of the 

PVC pipe extended to a depth of approximately 6 feet below grade.  A “riser” or non-slotted 

portion of PVC pipe was threaded onto the machine-slotted portion and extended vertically above 

ground surface of the open excavation, and was completed to the approximate level of the 

surrounding ground surface. 

 

On December 8, 2016, collected a groundwater sample from this well using a peristaltic pump and 

low flow methodology (USEPA, July 1996, revised January 2010).  Teflon-lined polyethylene 

tubing was lowered to within the approximate midpoint of the screened interval.  This tubing was 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 26 

 

   

 

 

connected to approximately 8-inches of silicone tubing which was placed in the pump head.  

Additional Teflon-lined polyethylene tubing was attached to the other end of the silicone tubing. 

 

Subsequent to measuring the depth of groundwater (3.05 feet), approximate three (3) well volumes 

of groundwater were purged from the well.  The sample was then collected into two unpreserved, 

1 liter amber glass containers provided by the laboratory.  The samples was submitted to Con-Test 

for analysis of PCBs by Method SW-846, 8082A.  The testing results, presented in Appendix E 

and summarized in Table 4, reveal that no PCBs were identified in concentrations equal to or in 

excess of the laboratory’s RL of 0.20 micrograms per liter (ug/l) which is below the RC of 5 ug/l 

for PCBs under the MCP for applicable groundwater category GW-2. 

 

6.6.5 Dust/Air Monitoring 

CJW performed real time monitoring at the active work zone and the Exclusion Zone perimeter in 

accordance with the Work Plan, Health and Safety Plan and Equipment Decontamination Plan that 

was developed for the project.  A Thermo Scientific personal DataRAM pDR-1000AN was used 

for this effort.  It is a passive, real-time, personal aerosol monitor/data logger capable of real-time, 

mass concentration measurements of dust, smoke, mists and fumes in real-time. 

 

This work was performed on December 5 and 6, 2016 when the when a frost permeated the near 

surface of the ground, a light snow covered the ground surface, the temperature ranged from 28 

degrees Fahrenheit (oF) to 35 oF, and the wind was reported (at the Worcester, MA Regional 

Airport) as 3 miles per hour (mph) to 14 mph.  These factors reduced the likelihood of the 

generation of any significant dust as the result of excavation activities. 

 

The baseline time-weighted average measured prior to the ground breaking was 0.018 mg/m3. As 

such, the airborne project criteria established for this project was not exceeded.  Measurements 

were taken every 15-minutes to 30-minutes during the work periods.  The highest concentrations 

measured were during jack-hammering of the concrete pads over a 45-minute period.  These 

concentrations ranged from 0.088 mg/m3 to 0.206 mg/m3.  Measurement recorded at other times 

ranged from 0.002 mg/m3 to 0.016 mg/m3.  As such, the airborne project criteria established for 

this project was not exceeded.

6.7 Disposal Site Boundary 

The lateral extent of the Disposal Site Boundary is shown on Figure 4 and is based upon the results 

of the verification sampling and analysis.  Table 1 reveals that the vertical extent of PCBs 

remaining is soil at the site extends to approximately 18 inches below grade in some areas.  No 

PCBs were identified in groundwater. 

 

7.0 RISK ASSESSMENT 

 

Under the MCP, the characterization of risk of harm to health, safety, public welfare and the 

environment is required for sites where the concentrations of contaminants have not been reduced 

to background levels as is the case at this site.  In accordance with 310 CMR 40.0902, a 

characterization of the risks posed by the release of oil or hazardous material (OHM) is required at 

disposal sites to provide the quantitative and qualitative information to evaluate the need for remedial 

actions, and to document that a level of No Significant Risk (NSR) of harm of health, safety, public 

welfare, and the environment exists or has been achieved.   

 

There are three methods available for performing a risk characterization.  Method 1 allows for the 

comparison of the concentrations of contaminants in soil and/or groundwater (and no other media) 

to standards that the MADEP has established for any site in Massachusetts.  A Method 2 risk 

characterization can also be used for soil and groundwater.  It supplements and modifies Method 

1 standards with site- and chemical-specific information.  A Method 3 risk characterization relies 

on detailed information about a specific site, the oil and/or hazardous material present in the 

environment at the site, and potential exposures to human and environmental receptors under all 

current and reasonably foreseeable site activities and uses to characterize the risk of harm posed 

by the identified contaminants.  It can be used for soil and groundwater but also can be used to 

assess other media such as indoor air, surface water, and sediments for which no Method 1 

standards exist. 

 

The conclusions presented in this PSS are based upon a Method 3 Risk Characterization which 

demonstrates that a condition of NSR of harm to health, safety, public welfare, and the 

environment exists at the disposal site.  The Method 3 Risk Characterization, presented in 

Appendix F, was performed for CJW by EnviroRisk Solutions, LLC of Stowe, Massachusetts.  It 

should be noted that the Method 3 Risk Assessment discussed herein includes site data covering 

both an IRA Completion Report and Permanent Solution Statement associated with the MADEP 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 28 

 

   

 

 

release RTN 2-19882 (release of hydraulic oil) and this SIP Completion Report, IRA Completion 

Report and PS Statement associated with RTN 2-19956 prepared by CJW. 

 

In summary, the results of the risk characterization reveal that a level of NSR to human health, 

public welfare, safety, and the environment has been achieved and no AUL is required to maintain 

the level of NSR.  As such a Permanent Solution has been attained.  However, a condition of the 

Permanent Solution, as noted in the Risk Characterization (Appendix F), is that Best Management 

Practices (BMP) be implemented for potential future gardening at the site.  Specifically, “since the 

estimated human health risks associated with ingestion of PCBs from soil that bioaccumulate into 

plants that are then eaten as produce were greater than non-cancer and cancer MassDEP risk limits, 

a Condition of the Permanent Solution for RTN 19956 is that Best Management Practices (BMP) 

will be implemented for potential future residential gardening at the site.  It should be noted that 

the BMP are for use of PCB-impacted site soil for growing home grown produce for consumption 

only and in no way restricts the use of outdoor raised beds or any gardening activity inside or 

outside the facility as long as the PCB-impacted soil is not used for produce that will be consumed. 

Landscaping of the PCB impacted area is not restricted so long as BMP are followed.  The BMP 

only pertains to the PCB impacted soil that is currently located at the southwestern exterior of the 

site building, where the site building abuts Brook Street.  The use of soil brought in from a source 

other than the PCB impacted area for gardening purposes is acceptable and in no way restricted.  

Therefore, this site as a whole is eligible for Permanent Solutions that do not require an AUL 

(40.1056(2)(j)(1).  To further emphasize, this condition only applies to the PCB-impacted soil area 

located on the southeastern exterior corner of the site building”. 

 

8.0 IMMINENT HAZARD EVALUATION 

 

Under the MCP, an (IH) is defined as a hazard that would pose a significant risk of harm to health, 

safety, public welfare or the environment if it were present for even a short period of time.  As 

described in Section 1.2.2, an IH was identified at the site due to the concentration of PCBs in 

near-surface soil.  However, the IH condition was initially negated once the 6-foot high chain link 

fence was erected around the site.  Subsequently, the successful cleanup of PCB impacted soil and 

concrete has resulted in remaining concentration of less than 1 mg/kg.  Therefore, no IH currently 

exists relative to this matter.   

  



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 29 

 

   

 

 

9.0 CRITICAL EXPOSURE PATHWAY EVALUATION 

 

Critical Exposure Pathways (CEPs), as defined in 310 CMR 40.0006, “means those routes by 

which oil or hazardous material (OHM) released at a disposal site are transported, or are likely to 

be transported, to human receptors via: 

 

 Vapor phase emissions of measurable concentrations of OHM into the living or working 

space of a pre-school, daycare, school or occupied residential dwelling; or 

 Ingestion, dermal absorption or inhalation of measurable concentrations of OHM from 

drinking water supply wells located at and servicing a pre-school, daycare, school or 

occupied residential dwelling. 

 

CJW is of the opinion that CEPs do not exist at the site relative to the release of PCBs to soil and 

concrete and as a result of cleanup activities. 

 

10.0 SUBSTANTIAL RELEASE MIGRATION EVALUATION 

 

Under the MCP, a Substantial Release Migration (SRM) is defined as the presence of one or more 

of the following conditions at a disposal site: 

 

 Releases that have resulted in the discharge of separate-phase oil and/or separate-phase 

hazardous material to surface waters, buildings, underground utilities or conduits; 

 Releases to the ground surface or vadose zone that, if not promptly removed or contained, are 

likely to significantly impact the underlying groundwater, or significantly exacerbate an 

existing condition of groundwater pollution; 

 Releases to groundwater that have migrated or area expected to migrate more than 200 feet 

per year; 

 Releases to the groundwater that have been or are within one year likely to be detected in a 

public or private drinking water well; 

 Releases to the groundwater that have been or are within one year likely to be detected in a 

surface water body, wetland, or public water supply reservoir; or 

 Releases to the groundwater or to the vadose zone that have resulted in or have the potential 

to result in the discharge of vapors into a School, Daycare of Child Care Center or occupied 

residential dwelling.

An SRM is not known to exist at the site. 

 

11.0 EQIUPMENT DECONTAMINATION 

 

Decontamination, when necessary, was performed in accordance with the Work Plan, Health and 

Safety Plan and Equipment Decontamination Plan that was developed for the project.  The 

management of decon liquids/materials is discussed in Section 12.3. 

 

12.0 MANAGEMENT OF WASTE 

 

12.1 PCB Transformer and Transformer Oil 

The PCB containing pad-mounted transformer was transported by TCI of NY, LLC to the TCI of 

Alabama, LLC facility in Pell City, Alabama for disposal (US EPA Facility ID No. 

ALD983167891).  The Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest (Manifest #003260039GBF) in 

Appendix G reveals that the transformer was received on December 15, 2016.  The transformer 

weighed 6,280 lbs. and contained 183 gallons of oil. 

 

12.2 Soil, Concrete and Personal Protective Equipment 

On August 16, 2016, MA DEP orally approved the removal/excavation of up to 25 cubic yards of 

impacted soil under an IRA.  With the submittal of the IRA Plan, CJW requested an additional 50 

cubic yards of impacted soil for removal/excavation bringing the total to 75 cubic yards. 

 

In accordance with 40 CFR 761.61(a)(5)(v)(A), bulk PCB remediation waste (PCB-impacted 

impacted concrete and soil) with PCB concentrations less than 50 mg/kg excavated and removed 

from the site was transported, under a Bill of Lading (BOL) (310 CMR 40.0034), to Waste 

Management of New Hampshire, Inc.’s Turnkey Recycling and Environmental Enterprise (TREE) 

Facility in Rochester, New Hampshire which is a fully permitted Subtitle D solid waste disposal 

facility. 

 

A total of 30.61 tons (approximately 19 to 20 cubic yards) of soil and concrete were transported 

off-site by NEDT in two (2) lined, covered steel roll-off containers, which were disposed of at the 

TREE facility in Rochester, New Hampshire on December 7 and 8, 2016, respectively. 

   

Additionally, three (3) drums of PCB impacted soils generated during the additional excavation 

activities conducted on December 15, 2016, and one (1) drum of personal protective equipment, 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 31 

 

   

 

 

totaling 0.82 tons of PCB remediation waste, were transported off-site by NEDT under BOL on 

January 26, 2017, to the TREE facility in Rochester, New Hampshire on February 14, 2017.  

 

At the completion of disposal activities, approximately 31.42 tons of PCB remediation waste 

transported under BOL to the TREE facility in Rochester, New Hampshire. 

 

Copies of the disposal documentation discussed in this Section are included in Appendix G. 

 

12.3 Liquid Waste 

One (1) drum of liquid waste (diesel fuel, detergent and water) resulting from the decontamination 

of the equipment used in the Exclusion Zone was analyzed by Con-Test for PCBs by US EPA 

Method 8082.  While PCBs were not detected in the sample at concentrations in excess of the 

Laboratory RLs, since the laboratory RLs were not able to meet the limits of 0.5 µg/L or 

approximately ≤ 0.5 ppb, which would have allowed for the unrestricted use under § 761.79(b)(1), 

the drum of liquid waste required incineration according to § 761.60. 

 

As such, one (1) drum of was transported off-site by NEDT on January 26, 2016, under Uniform 

Hazardous Waste Manifest (manifest tracking number 016972703JJK), to the ENPRO Services of 

Vermont, Inc. facility in Williston Vermont for incineration. A copy of the hazardous waste 

manifest is included in Appendix G. 

 

13.0 CONCLUSIONS AND LSP OPINION 

 

13.1 TSCA 

Based upon the assessment and cleanup of bulk PCB remediation waste under a SIP [40 CFR 

761.61(a)], it is our opinion that the SIP was successfully implemented and completed since the 

concentrations of soil and concrete remaining at the site meet the minimum requirement under 40 

CFR 761.61(a)(4)(i)(B) for Low Occupancy Areas of less than or equal to 25 parts per million 

(ppm).  Further, a deed notice is not required in accordance with 40 CFR 761.61(a)(8), since the 

cleanup resulted in concentrations of PCBs of less than 1 mg/kg (or 1 ppm).  Therefore, there is 

no restricted use of and for the site.   

 

ASTM International (2013) has prepared a guide which provides a systematic protocol to identify, 

prioritize, select, implement, and report on the use of greener cleanup best management practices 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 32 

 

   

 

 

(BMP) and the USEPA encourages the compliance with such practices.  Generally, BMPs 

employed at this site included: 

 

 The use of local staff to minimize resource consumption; and 

 The development and implementation of a properly devised site sampling plan that resulted 

in data representative of the site.  Systematic planning, a critical component of optimized 

strategies for investigating hazardous waste sites, involves identifying key decisions to be 

made, developing a CSM to support decision making, and evaluating decision uncertainty 

along with approaches for actively managing that uncertainty.  The CSM combines 

analytical data with historical information to identify data gaps and allows for refinement 

as additional data become available. 

 

13.2 MCP 

It is the opinion of the LSP-of-Record for this disposal site that this document meets the 

requirements of 310 CMR 40.0424 for an IRA Completion Report.  Based on the results of 

completed IRA activities, an IRA Completion Statement is considered appropriate pursuant to the 

requirements of 310 CMR 40.0427.  Response actions have abated this condition that initially 

required the IRA, stabilized disposal site conditions to the degree necessary, and neither an IH, 

SRM nor CEP exist at the site. 

 

It further meets the requirements of a Permanent Solution with Conditions (BMP only) in 

accordance with the 310 CMR 40.1040(1), and 40.1041(2).  The concentrations of PCBs remaining 

in soil at the site have been reduced to levels below the applicable MCP standards, such that, an 

AUL is not required to maintain a level of NSR pursuant to 310 CMR 40.1012(2).  Therefore, a 

Permanent Solution Statement is appropriate for the disposal site pursuant to 310 CMR 40.1040. 

 

The LSP-of-Record has reviewed the laboratory testing results and is of the opinion that laboratory 

quality control/quality assurance was appropriate for the tests that were performed. Further, the 

LSP is of the opinion that the quality control measures taken during sampling events for soil were 

of sufficient and appropriate nature to render an LSP opinion.  Five (5) duplicate discrete samples 

were collected during the IRA/SIP activities discussed herein.  The detected concentration of PCBs 

in A9 North SW 1’ BG (3.7 mg/Kg) and DUP-3 (7.0 mg/Kg) are not considered to be comparable, 

as the reported concentration in DUP-3 was approximately 1.9 times greater than was reported for 

the soil sample A9 North SW 1’ BG.  This discrepancy was likely due to the homogenization, or 

lack thereof, of the discrete soil sample; however, as the area was over-excavated and re-sampled, 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 33 

 

   

 

 

the A9 North SW 1’ BG soil sample and associated DUP-3 duplicate sample are not utilized/relied 

upon in the Method 3 Risk Characterization (Section 7.0).  Based upon the relative comparability 

of the analytical results of the samples and duplicates (excluding A9 North SW 1’ BG and DUP-

3), and based upon the completeness of the removal activities, the quality control measures are 

deemed appropriate.  In support of this opinion, the LSP has conducted an evaluation of the 

acceptability of the laboratory data used to characterize site conditions.  The results are 

summarized below.  

 

Pursuant to 310 CMR 40.0017 and 40.1056(2)(k), any person undertaking response actions under 

the provisions of the MCP shall ensure that analytical and environmental monitoring data used in 

support of recommendations, conclusions, or LSP opinions with respect to assessment, removal or 

containment actions are scientifically valid and defensible, and of a level of precision and accuracy 

commensurate with its stated or intended use. 

 

An evaluation of the overall quality and suitability of data utilized to support site characterization 

decisions and opinions at a disposal site is the responsibility of parties conducting response actions, 

and is subject to the requirements of the Response Action Performance Standard (RAPS) set forth 

in 310 CMR 40.0191.  Decisions that may directly impact data quality and suitability include: 

 

 Selection of an analytical service provider; 

 Identification of environmental sampling locations and parameters; 

 Identification of appropriate analytical methods and Reporting Limits; and 

 Specification of Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures and performance 

standards. 

 

In achieving the status of “Presumptive Certainty”, one will be assured that an analytical data set: 

 

 Satisfy the broad QA/QC requirements of 310 CMR 40.0017 and 40.0191 regarding the 

scientific defensibility, precision and accuracy, and reporting of analytical data; 

 May be used in a data usability assessment, and, if in compliance with all MCP Analytical 

Method standards, laboratory QC requirements, and field QC recommended limits and 

action levels, the data set will be considered usable data to support site characterization 

decisions made pursuant to the MCP; and 

 May be used to support a data representativeness assessment.

CJW collected all samples with the knowledge of the LSP-of-Record for this site in accordance 

with accepted practices.  Samples were collected in containers supplied by the laboratory.  The 

laboratory also supplied chemical preservatives, as necessary.  Samples were kept on ice in the 

field and refrigerated prior to pick up by the laboratory courier.  The samples were delivered to the 

laboratory under a chain-of-custody record. Based on the sample collection protocol and the 

responses made by the laboratory on the Analytical Report Certification Form (see Appendices of 

laboratory data), the LSP is of the opinion that the laboratory data is an acceptable data set 

identified for a data usability assessment. 

 

The LSP performed a review and assessment of the analytical data and quality control data for the 

laboratory testing results of the sampling performed during the period of May 18, 2016 through 

December 15, 2016, (collectively known as data) used to support opinions, conclusions, and/or 

recommendations contained in this document.  The complete laboratory analytical reports for oil, 

concrete, soil and groundwater not previously provided containing this data are provided in 

Appendices B through E, respectively.  

 

The data usability is based on an evaluation of the following parameters: precision, accuracy, 

representativeness, comparability, completeness, and sensitivity. 

 

Precision is a measure of mutual agreement among individual measurements of the same property, 

under prescribed conditions.  Precision was evaluated based on sample data repeatability that 

combines the cumulative precision of the sampling technique, non-homogeneity of the matrix, and 

the analytical method.  As previously mentioned, five (5) duplicate discrete soil samples were 

collected for laboratory analysis; however, the level of precision was not suitable from soil samples 

A9 North SW 1’ BG and DUP-3 (as discussed above), which were over-excavated as discussed in 

Section 6.6.2, and are not utilized/relied upon in the Method 3 Risk Characterization.  The 

precision of the remaining four (4) soil samples and associated duplicates were determined to be 

comparable.  Additionally, the reported concentrations of PCBs in the areas where remediation 

was not conducted and the post remediation soil samples were also comparable.  In all cases, the 

laboratory RLs were below the applicable MCP standards for the applicable soil or groundwater 

categories.  As such, CJW concludes that the precision of data collected at the site is acceptable. 

 

Accuracy is the degree of agreement of a measurement with an accepted reference or true value. 

The difference between the measurement and the true value is usually expressed as a percentage 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 35 

 

   

 

 

or ratio.  Accuracy was evaluated on various samples that were spiked by the laboratory such as 

control spikes, surrogates, matrix spike, and blanks. 

 

According to the laboratory analytical report assessment soil samples collected on August 9, 2016, 

the result for Aroclor-1254 was confirmed using a dissimilar column for soil sample S-5 0-6" BG, 

and the relative percent difference between the two results was >40%.  In accordance with the 

method, the higher result was reported.  CJW concludes that data validation is not affected, and it 

is unlikely that improved precision would affect the outcome of the risk characterization presented 

herein, as the higher result was reported. No other issues identified in the Case Narrative impacted 

the two (2) other soil sample results representative of remaining in-situ site soils. 

 

According to the laboratory analytical report assessment soil samples collected on September 1, 

2016, the sample to spike ratio was greater than or equal to 4:1, and the spiked amount was not 

representative of the native amount in the sample.  As such, appropriate or meaningful recoveries 

could not be calculated for Aroclor-1260 for the quality control laboratory Matrix Spike.  CJW 

concludes that data validation is not affected, and it is unlikely that improved precision would 

affect the outcome of the risk characterization presented herein, as sample to spike ratio does not 

impact/alter the detected concentration in the actual soil samples.  Additionally, the result for 

Aroclor-1254 was confirmed using a dissimilar column for soil sample S-20 0-6" BG, and the 

relative percent difference between the two results was >40%.  In accordance with the method, the 

higher result was reported.  CJW concludes that data validation is not affected, and it is unlikely 

that improved precision would affect the outcome of the risk characterization presented herein, as 

the higher result was reported. 

 

According to the laboratory analytical reports for post excavation soil samples collected on 

December 6, 2016, a dilution was performed as part of the standard analytical procedure for the 

soil samples: C6 North SW 1.25' Bg, C5 Bot 2 1/2' Bg, A4 Bot 1' Bg, D5 West SW 1.75' Bg, B6 

North SW 1.25' Bg, A6 North SW 2' Bg, A6 Bot 2 1/2' Bg, B5 Bot 2 1/2' Bg, C4 Bot 2' Bg and B7 

West SW 1/2' Bg.  CJW concludes that data validation is not affected, and it is unlikely that 

improved precision would affect the outcome of the risk characterization presented herein, as 

PCBs were not detected in any of the above referenced soil samples at concentrations equal to or 

in excess of the laboratory RLs.  Additionally, the surrogate recovery for soil sample DUP-3 was 

not available due to sample dilution below the surrogate reporting limit required from high analyte 

concentration and/or matrix interferences.  However, CJW concludes that data validation is not 

affected, and it is unlikely that improved precision would affect the outcome of the risk 



CJW Project #5812D – EPA SIP Completion; MCP IRAC/PSS for 179 Brook St., Clinton, MA 

February 15, 2017 Page 36 

 

   

 

 

characterization presented herein, as the location of DUP-3 (submitted from A9 North SW 1’ BG) 

was over-excavated (Section 6.6.2) as both the soil sample and duplicate contained PCBs at a 

concentration in excess of 1 mg/Kg. 

 

According to the laboratory analytical report for post excavation (over-excavation of samples 

exceeding 1 ppm PCBs) soil samples collected on December 15, 2016, a dilution was performed 

as part of the standard analytical procedure for the soil samples: B1 Bot 2’ BG, B1 East SW 1.5’ 

BG, B1 North SW 1.5’ BG and B1 West SW 1.5’ BG.  CJW concludes that data validation is not 

affected, and it is unlikely that improved precision would affect the outcome of the risk 

characterization presented herein, as PCBs were not detected in any of the above referenced soil 

samples at concentrations equal to or in excess of the laboratory RLs. 

 

According to the laboratory analytical reports, the reported results for remaining soil and 

groundwater used in the preparation of the Method 3 Risk Characterization were within defined 

laboratory quality control objectives. 

 

Representativeness expresses the degree to which data accurately and precisely represent a 

characteristic of a population, parameter variation, or environmental condition.  It is a qualitative 

assessment based on observed conditions and measurements.  The data and the results are 

considered to be representative of the conditions at the disposal site based on current site uses and 

field observations. 

 

Comparability expresses the confidence with which one data set can be compared to another.  It is 

typically evaluated based upon different rounds of response action.  Personnel from CJW 

performed four (4) rounds of assessment soil sampling, two (2) rounds of post remediation soil 

sampling, and one (1) round of groundwater sampling as part of this program.  CJW concludes 

that the comparability of the data sets used to characterize the site is acceptable as the results are 

similar.  

 

Completeness is a measure of the amount of valid data obtained from a measurement system 

compared to the amount expected under normal conditions and is usually expressed as a 

percentage.  Completeness was evaluated based on the total acceptable samples divided by the 

total collected samples times 100.  All of the post remediation soil samples and the groundwater 

sample discussed herein are considered acceptable for this submittal; therefore, a completeness 

goal of 100% has been attained.

Sensitivity is the ability of the method to detect the contaminant of concern at the concentration of 

interest, expressed as the Reporting Limit.  It is based on an evaluation of the laboratory’s RL as 

compared to the applicable MCP Method 1 standards for this disposal site.  For those samples 

where the laboratory reported non-detectable concentrations (method reporting limits), the RLs 

were below the applicable Method 1 standards.   

 

The LSP is of the opinion that the data are and of a level of precision and accuracy commensurate 

with their stated or intended use.

Re: PCB Cleanup and Disposal Approval under 40 CFR § 761.61(a) 
179 Brook Street 
Clinton, Massachusetts 

Dear Mr. Kelly: 

This is in response to The Kelly Company Inc (Kelly Company) Notification' to clean up and 
dispose of PCB remediation waste (e.g., concrete pads and soil) located at 179 Brook Street (the 
Site), Clinton, Massachusetts. The Site contains PCB concentrations that exceed the allowable PCB 
levels for unrestricted use under the federal PCB regulations at 40 CFR § 761.61 (a). The Kelly 
Company has requested an approval to clean up and dispose of the PCB-contaminated porous 
surfaces and PCB-contaminated soil located at the Site under the PCB self-implementing cleanup 
and disposal option at 40 CFR § 761.61(a). 

The Kelly Company is proposing the following PCB cleanup and disposal activities under 
§ 761.61(a): 

• Remove PCB-contaminated porous surfaces (i.e., active transformer concrete pad and 
vacant concrete pad) and PCB-contaminated soil as shown on Figure 6 of the Notification 
and dispose as a less than «) 50 parts per million (ppm) PCB remediation waste at a state 
pennitted solid waste landfill in accordance with 40 CFR § 761.61 (a)(5)(i)(B)(2)(ii) 

• Conduct verification sampling of the soil following removal of PCB remediation wasfe in 
accordance with 40 CFR Part 761 Subpart 0 to document that the PCB cleanup standard of 
less than or equal to (:S) I ppm has been met 

• In the event the PCB cleanup standard of~ 1 ppm cannot be achieved for the soil , a PCB 
cleanup standard of ~ 25 ppm will be used and a deed restriction will be recorded on the Site 

' Information was submiucd on behalf of The Kelly Company Inc by Cushing. Jammallo, & Whec1er. The information was provided to satisfy the 
notificat ion requirement under 40 CFR § 761.61(0)(3). Irlfonnal ion was provided dated October 7. 2016 (Self Implementing PCB Procedure Plan), 
October 27. 20 16 (Response 10 EPA comments and Revised Self Implementing PCB Procedure Plall); and October 31. 2016 (email l'igure 6 defining 
excavation areas) . These submiuals will be referred to as the "Notification."

RTN # 2-19882 (Hydraulic Oil Release) 

RTN # 2-19956 (PCB Release) 

 

Dear Mr. Jammallo: 
 
EnviroRisk Solutions, LLC has prepared this Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) Method 3 

Risk Characterization report for the Site located at 179 Brook Street in Clinton, Massachusetts.  

This Method 3 Risk Characterization of potential harm to human health, public welfare, safety 

and the environment associated with Site conditions was completed in accordance with the 

requirements of 310 CMR 40.0000 Subpart I of the MCP. 

 

The human health Risk Characterization evaluated potential risk to on-Site residents and 

construction/utility workers assumed to be exposed to  residual hydraulic oil constituents located 

under the building slab (RTN 2-19882) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) located on the 

exterior of the southeast corner of the Site building (RTN 2-19956). The results of the human 

health Risk Characterization demonstrate that a condition of No Significant Risk of harm to 

human health exists for current and reasonably foreseeable Site activities and uses. A condition 

of No Significant Risk of harm to safety, public welfare, and the environment was found under 

current and foreseeable conditions. The results of this Risk Characterization support a 

Permanent Solution with No Conditions for the hydraulic oil release and a Permanent Solution 

with Conditions for the PCB release. The only condition associated with the PCB release is that 

Best Management Practices (refer to Attachment E) be followed should PCB-impacted soil be 

used for gardening and the produce used for consumption.  Therefore, an Activity and Use 

Limitation is not required for RTN 2-19956.

1.0  INTRODUCTION 

EnviroRisk Solutions, LLC is pleased to provide this report summarizing the results of a 

Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) Method 3 Risk Characterization performed for 179 

Brook Street, Clinton, Massachusetts (the “Site”). The Site under evaluation is a manufacturing 

and warehouse building, which is located within in a mixed commercial/industrial/residential 

area of Clinton, Massachusetts. This Method 3 Risk Characterization of potential harm to 

human health, public welfare, safety and the environment associated with Site conditions was 

completed in accordance with the requirements of 310 CMR 40.0000 Subpart I of the MCP. 

 

This Risk Characterization evaluates residual soil and groundwater impacts at the Site property 

that are associated with historic release(s) of free phase hydraulic oil [Release Tracking Number 

(RTN) 2-19882] that was observed in multiple sump/collection basins located within the site 

building. Additionally, during investigations to determine if a release of polychlorinated biphenyls 

(PCBs) had occurred from an existing pad mounted transformer, an area of PCB impacted soil 

was identified at the southwestern exterior of the Site building. The PCBs detected in soil were 

also evaluated in this risk characterization. 

 

This Risk Characterization was conducted in accordance with 310 CMR 40.0900 of the MCP 

(MADEP, 2014), the MADEP’s Guidance for Disposal Site Risk Characterization - In Support of 

the MCP (MADEP, 1996), and current risk assessment practice in Massachusetts.  The purpose 

of this Risk Characterization was to evaluate the potential risk of harm to health, safety, public 

welfare, and the environment posed by Site conditions.   

 

This Risk Characterization is an Appendix to both an Immediate Response Action Completion 

Report and Permanent Solution Statement associated with MADEP RTN 2-19882, and a Self-

Implementing Procedure (SIP) Completion Report, Immediate Response Action Completion

1.1 Background 

 
This Method 3 Human Health and Environmental Risk Characterization addresses soil and 

groundwater impact associated with residual contamination from releases of hydraulic oil and 

PCBs at 179 Brook Street in Clinton, Massachusetts. The Site area consists of the area of the 

manufacturing and warehouse building. Concentrations of constituents in all Site media are 

expected to continue to decrease over time because the source, the manufacturing equipment 

and much of the impacted soil, was removed. 

1.2 Approach 

A Method 3 approach to characterize risk was selected for the Site because the impacts in soil 

and groundwater at the Site warranted a Site-specific evaluation.  As specified in the MCP, 

application of a Method 3 Risk Characterization is acceptable for any site.  The human health 

evaluation of the Method 3 Risk Characterization approach involved four (4) steps.  The first 

step, Hazard Identification, involved identification of the Constituents of Potential Concern 

(COPCs) detected at the Site and any adverse carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic effects 

associated with the COPCs.  The second step, Dose-Response Assessment, described the 

relationship between the magnitude of exposure for each COPC (dose) and the occurrence of 

specific health effects for a potential receptor (response).  The third step, Exposure 

Assessment, involved identification of potential human receptors, based on characteristics of 

the Site and the surrounding area.  Subsequently, the magnitude and frequency of receptors’ 

potential exposure to COPCs was quantified.  This step also included review of the spatial and 

temporal aspects of groundwater conditions at the subject property in the Reports to provide a 

basis for selecting regulatory criteria and exposure scenarios under a Method 3 Risk 

Characterization at this particular site.   

 

The fourth step, Risk Characterization, combined the information from the Exposure 

Assessment with the information from the Dose-Response Assessment to derive quantitative 

estimates of the likelihood of potential adverse health effects or potential carcinogenic effects.  

These effects were estimated for each receptor for each potential exposure pathway identified 

in the Exposure Assessment.  The potential risk estimates for each exposure pathway were 

summed to obtain a cumulative estimate of total risk for each receptor.  Details regarding these 

human health assessment steps, as well as the characterization of risk to human safety, public 

welfare, and the environment, are provided in the remainder of this Risk Characterization 

document. 

 

The Site will continue to be a manufacturing or commercial facility with a warehouse for the 

foreseeable future. The Site is located in a mixed industrial/commercial and residential area of 

Clinton, Massachusetts. No Activity and Use Limitation (AUL) will be implemented at this Site.

The only condition at Site is to use Best Management Practices (BMP) when using the Site soil 

for gardening purposes relating to the RTN for PCBs (2-19956). 

 

This Risk Characterization was conducted using conservative assumptions and methods.  For 

example, conservative exposure point concentrations for each of the affected media were 

calculated by considering the contaminant distribution and, as applicable, focusing on the areas 

of the Site where contaminant concentrations were highest.  These and other conservative 

assumptions and methods used to prepare this Risk Characterization are described in the 

following sections. 

2.0 HAZARD IDENTIFICATION 

This section includes a description of the data used as the basis of the Risk Characterization 

and presents the selection of COPC, and the references to Tables from this point forward refer 

to those included within this Risk Characterization document and should be distinguished from 

those referenced in the Reports.  

General comparisons to Method 1 standards are made in the following paragraphs for 

discussion purposes to give an indication of the levels of impact at the Site.  Method 1 

standards are not applicable in this Method 3 Risk Characterization. 

2.1 Data Sets 

2.1.1 Soil 

Table 1 presents the current soil analytical data set used in this Risk Characterization. A total of 

thirty-eight soil samples were collected from the Site at various intervals between approximately 

0 and 6 feet below grade and analyzed for extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH) fractions 

with target polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Nine soil samples were analyzed for 

volatile petroleum hydrocarbons (VPH) fractions, thirteen soil samples were analyzed for volatile 

organic compounds (VOCs), and four soil samples were analyzed for metals. An additional 

forty-five soil samples were collected at intervals between zero and two feet below grade and 

analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Soil samples were collected at the Site during 

Site investigations and post-excavation between May and November 2016. Soil samples 

presented in this risk characterization represent current conditions and do not include soil 

samples that have been removed from the Site. 

 

Residual soil samples contained total EPH fractions (i.e., the total of the three EPH fraction 

ranges within a sample) at concentrations ranging from non-detectable levels to 14,410 mg/kg. 

The highest concentrations of EPH fractions were detected in soil samples MW-15 (3 to 4 feet), 

MW-15B (3 to 4 feet), MW-20 (2 to 4 feet), MW-21 (1 to 3 feet), CS-7A (1 to 4.5 feet), and CS-

8A (1 to 4.5 feet). C19 to C35 aliphatic fractions in each of these soil samples were greater than 

Method 1 S-1/GW-2 and S-1/GW-3 soil standards. Total PAHs were detected at concentrations

Page 4 

ranging from non-detectable levels to 128 mg/kg. The highest concentrations of PAHs were 

detected in soil samples CS-14 SW (1 to 4.5 feet) and CS-2 SW (1 to 4.5 feet). The detected 

PAHs did not exceed Method 1 S-1 standards. The higher concentrations of detected PAHs 

were not in the same areas as the higher concentrations of detected EPH fractions. 

 

Detections of VPH fractions and VOCs were minimal and well below Method 1 S-1 soil 

standards. Metals including copper, mercury, selenium, thallium, and zinc were detected in soil 

collected from the Site at concentrations greater than MassDEP Background concentrations in 

natural soil. However, the detected concentrations of metals were less than Method 1 S-1 soil 

standards. 

 

PCBs, as Aroclor 1254 and 1260, were detected in fifteen of forty-five soil samples at total PCB 

concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg. 

2.1.2 Groundwater 

Groundwater samples were collected from thirty-one monitoring wells between May 2016 and 

January 2017 and analyzed for EPH fractions and target PAHs. Groundwater collected prior to 

May 2016 was reviewed to determine concentration trends but not included in this risk 

characterization because groundwater collected within the last year is representative of current 

conditions at the Site post-remediation. Groundwater was collected from monitoring wells on up 

to three occasions between May 2016 and January 2017. Groundwater collected from individual 

monitoring wells was averaged over time to represent the concentrations of constituents within 

that monitoring well. One-half the detection limit was used to represent instances where data 

was not detected. Refer to Table 2 for a summary of groundwater data used in this risk 

characterization. No light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) has been observed in any 

monitoring wells since the completion excavation activities in November 2016. 

 

Groundwater collected from Site monitoring wells contained total EPH fractions at time-weighted 

well-averaged concentrations ranging from non-detectable levels to 3,225 μg/L; limited EPH 

fractions were only detected in five monitoring wells. The highest concentrations of EPH 

fractions were detected in monitoring well MW-15 in December 2016 and no EPH fractions were 

detected in a subsequent groundwater sample collected from MW-15 in January 2017. PAHs 

were detected in groundwater from one of thirty-one monitoring wells, MW-10. There was also 

single detection of naphthalene in a groundwater sample collected from RMW-1. No EPH 

fractions or PAHs were detected at concentrations exceeding the Method 1 GW-2 or GW-3 

groundwater standards. Detected concentrations of constituents in groundwater have generally 

decreased over time or remained at non-detectable concentrations since completion of 

excavation activities.  

 

VPH fractions, VOCs and PCBs were not detected above detection limits in groundwater 

collected from the Site.

Metals detected in Site groundwater included concentrations of arsenic, copper, nickel and zinc. 

It should be noted that none of the Site-related constituents (EPH fractions, PAHs, PCBs) were 

detected in the groundwater that contained these low concentrations of metals. These metals 

were detected in groundwater at concentrations well below Method 1 GW-3 groundwater 

standards. It is unlikely that the low concentrations of metals detected in groundwater are Site-

related. They may represent natural background concentrations of metals in groundwater in the 

area of the Site. 

2.2 Identification of Background Conditions 

Background conditions are defined in the MCP (310 CMR 40.0006) as those levels of oil and 

hazardous material that would exist in the absence of the disposal site of concern, including 

both Natural Background and Anthropogenic Background. 

 

As shown on Table 3, the maximum detected concentrations of PAHs and metals in soil were 

compared to Massachusetts Background concentrations in “natural” soil. Detections of several 

PAHs were greater than background concentrations. Therefore, PAHs were conservatively not 

excluded from consideration in this risk characterization. Detected concentrations of arsenic, 

barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, and nickel were less than background 

concentrations and therefore, were eliminated from this risk characterization on this basis. Other 

metals detected in soil were retained and evaluated in the risk characterization. 

 

There are no published background concentrations of metals in groundwater. Therefore, 

although the concentrations of metals detected in groundwater were less than Method 1 GW-3 

standards and were not co-located with constituents of potential concern (COPC) at the Site 

(EPH fractions, PAHs, and PCBs), they were conservatively retained as possible COPC. 

2.3 Selection of Constituents of Potential Concern 

With the exceptions of arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, and nickel in soil 

that are at concentrations that are equivalent to natural background in soil as discussed above, 

all constituents detected in at least one (1) sample were evaluated to determine if it was 

appropriate to include them as constituents of potential concern (COPCs).  The COPCs for soil 

include EPH fractions, PAHs, the VPH fraction C9 to C10 aromatic fractions, naphthalene, 

toluene, and metals (copper, mercury, selenium, thallium, and zinc), and PCBs. The COPCs for 

groundwater include EPH fractions, PAHs, and metals. Because arsenic and nickel were less 

than background concentrations in soil, the limited detections of arsenic and nickel detected in 

groundwater are likely to be part of the background as well. Also, since the low detections of 

metals in groundwater were not co-located with COPC in groundwater, these metals are likely a 

background condition. However, they were conservatively retained as COPCs in groundwater.

3.0 DOSE-RESPONSE ASSESSMENT 

The purpose of the Dose-Response Assessment was to identify the relationship between the 

magnitude of COPCs to which receptors may be exposed (dose) and the likelihood of an 

adverse health effect (response).  Both noncarcinogenic (i.e., threshold) and carcinogenic (i.e., 

non-threshold) health effects were considered in the Dose-Response Assessment.  The 

information provided in the Dose-Response Assessment was combined with the results of the 

Exposure Assessment (Section 4.0) to provide an estimate of potential health risk (Section 5.0). 

 

Dose-response information used in this risk assessment was obtained from MADEP (MADEP, 

2015).  Sources of toxicity data are listed on the MADEP website at 

http://www.mass.gov/dep/service/compliance/riskasmt.htm under the Numerical Standards 

Development Worksheets. The only exception to using the MADEP Numerical Standards was 

the use of the toxicity values for benzo(a)pyrene that were recently released by US EPA 

Integrated Risk Information Systems (IRIS) (US EPA, 2017). These new values not only affect 

benzo(a)pyrene but also other PAHs that have toxicity values based on the benzo(a)pyrene 

numbers as detailed below and presented in Table 5.

The updated oral cancer slope factor and inhalation unit risk for benzo(a)pyrene were used to 

estimate the values for the other carcinogenic PAHs including benzo(a)anthracene, 

benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, and 

indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene. A relative potency factor was applied to each carcinogenic PAH to 

account for the compounds that are less toxic than benzo(a)pyrene as follows: 

PAH Relative Potency Factors 

Carcinogenic PAH Relative Potency Factor 

benzo(a)anthracene 0.1 

benzo(b)fluoranthene 0.1 

benzo(k)fluoranthene 0.01 

chrysene 0.001 

dibenzo(a,h)anthracene 1 

indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene 0.1 

 

For non-cancer toxicity values, the oral reference dose and inhalation reference concentration 

for benzo(a)pyrene were used as surrogate compounds for many of the PAHs for which there 

are no non-cancer toxicity values. Refer to Table 5 for the undated values. 

3.1 Noncarcinogenic Dose-Response 

Constituents with known or potential noncarcinogenic effects are assumed to have a dose 

below which no adverse effect occurs, or conversely, above which an effect may be seen. In 

laboratory experiments, this dose is known as the “No Observed Adverse Effect Level” 

(NOAEL).  The lowest dose at which an adverse effect is seen is called the “Lowest Observed 

Adverse Effect Level” (LOAEL).  By applying uncertainty factors to the NOAEL or the LOAEL, 

the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) developed Reference Doses 

(RfDs) for chronic and, in some cases, subchronic, exposures to constituents with potential 

noncarcinogenic effects (USEPA, 2008).  Subchronic toxicity values were used for evaluating 

exposure lasting from several days up to seven (7) years. 

 

Uncertainty factors account for uncertainties associated with the dose-response data, such as 

the appropriateness of using an animal study to derive a human dose-response value, and the 

potential for sensitive subpopulations to exist, which may not be adequately represented by the 

laboratory testing of animals.  For constituents with potential noncarcinogenic effects, the RfD or 

Reference Concentration (RfC) provides reasonable certainty through the use of uncertainty 

factors that, if the specified exposure dose is below the threshold, then no noncarcinogenic 

health effects are expected to occur.  RfDs are expressed in terms of milligrams of compound 

per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg-day) and are used to evaluate estimated doses 

from oral and dermal exposures.  RfCs are expressed in terms of milligrams of compound per 

cubic meter of air (mg/m3) and are used to evaluate estimated inhalation exposures in a specific 

exposure context (e.g., continuous exposure for a chronic period of time).  Table RS-7 

(Attachment C – on-Site resident) and Tables CW-5 and CWGW-5 (Attachment D –

construction/utility worker) summarize the toxicity information for the COPCs evaluated at this 

Site for the inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure routes. 

3.2 Carcinogenic Dose-Response 

In 2005, the USEPA published new guidelines (USEPA, 2005) for evaluating carcinogenic risk 

in which a new weight of evidence approach considers all scientific information in determining 

whether and under which conditions an agent may cause cancer in humans.  In addition, the 

new guidelines provide a narrative approach to characterizing carcinogenicity rather than using 

specific categories (e.g., Group A and Group B).  Although the 2005 revised guidelines are the 

basis of the USEPA's guidance to evaluating cancer risk, not all constituents in the Integrated 

Risk Information System (IRIS) database have been revised under the new guidelines. 

 

Under the previous cancer risk assessment guidelines (USEPA, 1986), the underlying 

assumption of regulatory risk assessment for constituents with known or assumed potential 

carcinogenic effects was that no threshold dose exists.  In other words, it was assumed that a 

finite level of risk is associated with any dose above zero (0).  Theoretically, even a single 

molecule could cause some level of risk.  For carcinogenic effects, the USEPA risk assessment 

guidelines (USEPA, 1986) used a two-step evaluation in which the compound was assigned a 

weight-of-evidence classification, and then a cancer slope factor was calculated.  Cancer slope 

factors are a numerical estimate of the carcinogenic potency of a compound.  The weight-of-

evidence classification was based on the likelihood of the compound being a human 

carcinogen.   

 

Under this system, which is still in place for constituents in IRIS that have not been revised 

since 1999, Group A constituents are classified as human carcinogens, Group B constituents 

are probable human carcinogens, Group C constituents are possible human carcinogens, 

Group D constituents are not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity, and for Group E 

constituents there is evidence of noncarcinogenicity for humans.  Furthermore, in the second 

part of the evaluation, cancer slope factors were calculated for constituents that are known or 

probable human carcinogens.   

 

The risk assessment guidelines (USEPA, 1986) used linear models in the low dose region 

(which represents environmental exposure) as a default to estimate cancer slope factors.  The 

USEPA's approach was to use the upper ninety-five (95) percent confidence bound on the slope 

of the line generated by the linear model to estimate the potency of carcinogens.  Such 

potencies were then used to estimate risks at various exposures. 

 

Under the new cancer guidelines (USEPA, 2005), one (1) of the most important features is the 

incorporation of greater emphasis on mechanisms for carcinogenic action.  The USEPA has 

proposed a departure from using linearized models to relate doses to responses when the mode 

of action is deemed not to be genotoxic.  In these cases, the guidelines propose to use a

Page 9 

benchmark dose approach to risk assessment (USEPA, 2005).  A benchmark approach uses a 

model to determine the dose that would result in a defined rate of an outcome, usually five (5) or 

ten (10) percent.  Safety factors can then be applied to this benchmark dose level.  

 

Table RS-8 (Attachment C – on-Site resident) and Tables CW-5 and CWGW-5 (Attachment D – 

construction/ utility worker) summarize toxicity information for COPCs assumed by the MADEP 

to produce potential carcinogenic effects through the oral and inhalation routes of exposure, 

respectively.  Carcinogenic toxicity values for oral exposure are cancer slope factors and are 

expressed in terms of (mg/kg-day)-1; carcinogenic toxicity values for inhalation exposures are 

inhalation unit risk values and are expressed in terms of 1/microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3)-1. 

 

Unit risk values are defined as the upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risk estimated to result 

from continuous exposure to an agent at a concentration of 1 µg/m3 in air (USEPA, 2005).  For 

this evaluation, unit risk values were converted to an inhalation cancer slope factor correcting 

for body weight, inhalation rates, and units using the following equation: 

 

 x 1000 µg/mg 

where: 

CSFinh = inhalation cancer slope factor (mg/kg-day)-1 

 

URinh  = inhalation unit risk (µg/m3)-1 

70 kg  = body weight 

1000 µg/mg = conversion factor in micrograms per milligram; and 

20 m3/ day = inhalation rate in cubic meters per day. 

4.0 EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT 

This section identifies the type and magnitude of potential exposures to COPCs that may occur 

at the Site under current and reasonably foreseeable future use.  First, potential receptors were 

identified based on conditions present at the Site and surrounding area.  Next, potential routes 

and pathways of exposure were identified for each receptor based on information about 

activities that typically occur or could be expected to occur at the Site.  

 

Consistent with the requirements of the MCP (310 CMR 40.0923), the exposure assessment 

considered both current and reasonably foreseeable future Site activities and uses, and it is 

assumed future use is in no way restricted by an AUL.  Also refer to Section 5.0 of the Report 

for Exposure Assessment information.  Table 4 presents the exposure assessment summary.

4.1 Site Use and Activities  

This risk characterization evaluates the Site located at 179 Brook Street, a manufacturing facility 

and warehouse in an industrial/commercial/residential neighborhood. Under current conditions, 

receptors include employees that work at the Site. Customers, visitors and/or trespassers may 

also visit the Site, however, on an irregular basis. Although no utility or construction work is 

scheduled, utility or construction workers may be present at the Site in the future to perform 

utility repair, construction or maintenance activities. In the future, should the Site be 

redeveloped, construction workers may also be present during Site redevelopment. Under 

future foreseeable uses, since there are no activity and use limitations on the property, it was 

assumed that the Site may be redeveloped for residential use. 

 

The Site is defined as an area where contamination is located or has come to be located.  For 

this evaluation, the Site soil associated with the hydraulic oil release is located at depths 

generally between 0 and 6 feet below grade in soil that is currently under the slab of the 

manufacturing facility and the Site soil associated with the PCB impacts are on the exterior of 

the southeast corner of the facility in shallow soil. Residual impacts of hydraulic oil in 

groundwater are extremely limited and were detected in a few monitoring wells located in the 

building slab of the manufacturing facility. No PCBs were detected in groundwater collected 

from the Site. Residual impacts of hydraulic oil are represented by monitoring wells MW-10, 

MW-15, MW-15A, MW-15B, and MW-15C which contained limited concentrations of EPH 

fractions or PAHs. Constituents analyzed in groundwater collected from monitoring wells MW-1, 

MW-2, MW-4, MW-6, MW-14, MW-16, MW-20, MW-21, MW-22, MW-25, MW-27, MW-E, MW-F, 

MW-M, MW-N, MW-O, MW-P, RMW-2, RMW-3, RMW-4, RMW-5, RMW-6, and RMW-7 were at 

non-detectable concentrations. 

 

Hydraulic oil constituents would not be considered volatile under the MADEP Vapor Intrusion 

(VI) Policy (MADEP, 2016). According to the policy, “VOCs are defined in the MCP (310 CMR 

40.0006(12)) as an organic compound with a boiling point equal to or less than 218°C that are 

targeted analytes in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Method 

8260B and other purgeable organic methods specified in the Department’s Compendium of 

Analytical Methods.” A review of the documented boiling point of hydraulic oil indicates that 

hydraulic oil has a boiling point of greater than 316°C (Oilman Group, 2014; CGF, 2009). Since 

there were only minimal detections of VPH fractions and VOCs in soil, no VPH fractions or 

VOCs in groundwater, and the constituents that were detected in soil and groundwater are not 

considered volatile, volatilization of constituents into indoor air is not considered a complete 

exposure pathway at this Site.  

 

There are no Zone II Areas, Interim Wellhead Protection Areas (IWPA), Zone A, Potentially 

Productive Aquifers, or private wells within 500 feet of the disposal Site. An industrial process 

water supply well is located within the footprint of the building structure, within the northwestern 

portion of the building; however, this well is not, and has never been, connected to any of the 



EnviroRisk Solutions, LLC 
Complex Sites, Resourceful Solutions 

 

 
C:\Users\Marie\Documents\Marie's work\CJW\Clinton\indust facility\Clinton risk characterization final.docx 

 
Page 11 

bathrooms, sinks, or any other fixture from which any person at the site would come in contact.  

The industrial process water supply well has not been utilized at the site for approximately 20 

years, according to the property owner, and is not currently connected to any systems at the site 

building. 

 

There are no wetlands, vernal pools, ponds, lakes, rivers, or reservoirs within 500 feet of the 

disposal Site. However, Rigby Brook is located south of the property, flows through a concrete 

culvert under a portion of the property and exits the culvert to the northeast of the property. 

There are no Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), Sole Source Aquifers, fish 

habitats or habitats of Species of Special Concern or Threatened or Endangered Species. 

4.2 Soil and Groundwater Categorization 

Soil and groundwater were categorized, as is required by the MCP (310 CMR 40.0930). 

 

The Site is located within an industrial/commercial and residential area of Clinton, 

Massachusetts.  Since the Site area associated with the release of hydraulic oil (RTN 2-19882) 

is located under the building slab, Site soil associated with the hydraulic oil release is 

considered inaccessible. The PCB impacted soil (RTN 2-19956) is located at the southeastern 

exterior of the building and is therefore, considered accessible. Under current conditions, it is 

assumed that employees may have high frequency of contact because they work at the Site and 

low intensity of contact with Site soil since Site soil is located under the building slab.  Under 

hypothetical future conditions, should the Site be redeveloped and soil that is currently under 

the building slab become accessible, future residents may have high frequency and high 

intensity contact with soil.  Under future redevelopment conditions, construction/utility workers 

would have low frequency and high intensity exposure to Site soil.  Based on these potential 

exposures, Site soil is categorized as S-2 and S-3 under current conditions and S-1 under 

potential future conditions.  Soil under building foundations is always categorized as S-3 per 310 

CMR 40.0933. 

 

Groundwater underlying the Site does not meet the definitions of a Current or Potential Drinking 

Water Source Area (310 CMR 40.0932). Therefore, the Site does not meet the criteria for 

GW-1. 

 

Under current conditions, the groundwater under the Site building meets the criteria for GW-2. 

Site groundwater is categorized as GW-3 (310 CMR 40.0932(2)) because all groundwater of the 

Commonwealth is assumed to discharge to surface water and thus meets the criteria for this 

category. 

4.3 Identification of Receptors and Exposure Pathways 

Potential receptors that were evaluated for the Site include hypothetical, future on-Site residents 

and construction/utility workers.  Employees, off-Site residents, visitors, and trespassers were

Complex Sites, Resourceful Solutions

Page 12 

considered to be lesser exposed receptors than the on-Site residents.  Therefore, risks 

calculated for the on-Site resident are protective of potential risks to these other receptors.  

Consistent with the requirements of the MCP (310 CMR 40.0923), the exposure assessment 

considered both current and reasonably foreseeable future Site activities and uses.  Refer to 

Table 4 for a review of potential exposure pathways. 

 

The Site is not located in a GW-1 drinking water area (refer to Section 4.2).  Therefore, use of 

groundwater as potable water at the Site and at surrounding properties is not a complete 

exposure pathway. 

 

Exposure pathways are the mechanisms by which receptors may be exposed to COPCs at the 

Site.  According to USEPA (1989) and MADEP (1995), the following elements must be present 

in order for a potential human exposure pathway to be complete: 

 A constituent source 

 A mechanism by which a constituent may be released to the environment 

 An environmental transport medium 

 An exposure point (discussed above), and 

 A receptor with a route of exposure at the point of contact (discussed above) 

 

As mentioned above, potential Site receptors evaluated include hypothetical, future on-Site 

residents and construction/utility workers.  Although hydraulic oil impacted soil is currently under 

the building slab, hypothetical on-Site residents were conservatively assumed to be exposed to 

both hydraulic oil and PCB impacted soil via dermal contact and incidental ingestion under 

hypothetical future conditions. As mentioned above, the PCB impacted soil is located at the 

southeastern exterior of the building. 

 

Based on the lack of significant detections of VOCs and VPH fractions in soil or groundwater, 

migration of volatiles into indoor air of the Site building or future residence were not considered 

complete exposure pathways. 

 

Construction/utility workers were conservatively assumed to be exposed to soil via incidental 

ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation of particulates.  Construction/utility workers were also 

assumed to be exposed to groundwater via dermal contact. 

 

Concentrations of VOCs and VPH fractions in groundwater collected from the subject property 

were less than Method 1 GW-2 groundwater standards. Therefore, the detections are not 

considered to be a significant pathway in indoor air. For volatile concentrations in an open 

trench where vapors are less likely to accumulate, concentrations of volatile constituents will be 

even less then would be likely in indoor air.  Based on the length of time construction workers 

are in a trench, they are lesser exposed receptors than residents. Therefore, construction

Page 13 

worker exposure to volatile constituents in a trench from groundwater was also eliminated as an 

exposure pathway. 

 

The MADEP Short Forms (MADEP, 2012 with updates March 2015) were used to estimate 

potential risks to on-Site resident receptor exposure to soil via dermal contact and incidental 

ingestion.  MADEP Short forms were used to estimate potential risks to construction/utility 

workers exposed to soil via dermal contact, incidental ingestion, and inhalation of fugitive dust. 

Modified Short form tables were used to estimate potential risks to construction/utility worker via 

groundwater exposures. The exposure assumptions used in the evaluation of these receptors 

are presented in Tables RS-6 (Attachment C) and CW-4 and CWGW-4 (Attachment D). 

 

On-Site residential exposure to soil via dermal contact and incidental ingestion was calculated 

assuming that residents would encounter soil 5 days per week over a period of 30 weeks per 

year for 30 years.  The exposure assumptions for a resident are equivalent to the MADEP 

default values published in MADEP Short Form worksheets (MADEP, 2012 with March 2015 

updates).  The ingestion rate is assumed to be 100 mg/day soil for young children and 50 

mg/day soil for older children and adults.  Surface area was based on exposure to face, 

forearms, lower legs, and feet.  These exposure assumptions are presented in Table RS-6 in 

Attachment C.   

 

Construction/utility worker exposure to soil via dermal contact, incidental ingestion, and 

inhalation of fugitive dust was calculated assuming that workers would encounter soil in an 

excavation during utility repair or Site redevelopment work.  Workers were assumed to be 

exposed to soil 8 hours per day, 5 days per week over a period of six months.  The exposure 

assumptions for a construction/utility worker are consistent with MADEP default values 

published in MADEP Short form worksheets (MADEP, 2012 with March 2015 updates).  For 

dermal contact with groundwater, construction/utility workers were assumed to be exposed to 

groundwater 5 days per week over a period of six months. Since groundwater is pumped from 

excavations for the safety of workers during utility or excavation work, workers were assumed to 

be exposed to groundwater 1.0 hour per day for set up of dewatering equipment. These 

exposure assumptions are presented on Table CW-4 and CWGW-4 in Attachment D. 

 

No COPCs are considered by MADEP to be acutely toxic constituents.  Therefore, no acute 

exposure pathways were performed in this evaluation. 

 

4.4 Exposure Areas 

Exposure areas, or exposure points, are defined as locations of potential contact between a 

receptor and portions/media of the Site. The exposure point concentration (EPC) is thereby 

defined as the COPC concentration in the soil that a potential receptor may encounter within an 

exposure area. The exposure points evaluated in this Risk Characterization are described

below. The estimation of EPCs, based on the selected exposure points, is described in Section 

4.5. 

4.4.1 Soil  

The exposure point at this Site is defined as the area of soil located beneath the building slab 

where petroleum hydrocarbon impact has come to be located and an area at the southeastern 

exterior of the building where the PCB impacted soil has come to be located.  Soil samples MW-

14 (3 to 5 feet), MW-23 (0 to 2.5 feet), MW-25 (0 to 2.5 feet), MW-26 (2 to 4 feet), and MW-27 

(0 to 2.5 feet), were conservatively eliminated from calculation of the EPC because they 

contained concentrations of constituents that were at non-detectable concentrations or slightly 

above detection limits, however, these soil samples are within the Site boundaries. 

 

For EPH fractions and PAHs, the arithmetic mean concentrations of detected concentrations in 

soil, with the exclusion of those five soil samples, were used to represent EPCs. The use of the 

arithmetic mean for soil EPCs for EPH fractions and PAHs is applicable at this Site because of 

the relatively large data set (38 samples were analyzed for EPH fractions and PAHs) and since 

soil samples that contained low or non-detectable concentrations were eliminated from the EPC 

calculations, skewing the data to higher concentrations. Furthermore, a review of the distribution 

of the data collected from the Site indicated that soil samples were collected preferentially in the 

area of highest petroleum impact based on PID readings during sampling. Therefore, the 

arithmetic mean calculated for EPCs for EPH fractions and PAHs likely represents 

concentrations that are higher and more conservative than the true mean concentrations in soil 

across the Site. 

 

Since fewer soil samples were analyzed for VPH fractions, VOCs and metals, the maximum 

detected concentrations of these constituents were conservatively selected as the EPCs. 

 

PCBs were detected in only fifteen of forty-five soil samples. Forty-five soil samples is an 

adequate data set to represent the relatively small area in which the PCBs were detected. 

However, to not dilute the arithmetic mean concentration with the large number of non-detects, 

the arithmetic mean for PCBs was calculated using only detected concentrations of PCBs even 

though many of the samples that did not contain detectable concentrations were within the Site 

area. This yields a conservative EPC estimate. 

4.4.2 Groundwater 

For groundwater, each individual monitoring well is considered its own exposure point.  The 

maximum well-averaged concentration of each constituent was used to represent EPCs for 

groundwater. Residual impacts are represented by monitoring wells MW-10, MW-15, MW-15A, 

MW-15B, and MW-15C which contained limited concentrations of EPH fractions or PAHs. 

Groundwater EPCs were used to evaluate dermal contact with groundwater, for comparison to

Page 15 

upper concentration limits (UCLs), and for comparison to ambient water quality benchmarks in 

the downgradient surface water body (Rigby Brook). 

4.4.3 “Hot spot” Evaluation 

MADEP Guidance (MADEP, 1996) defines a “hot spot” as an area where concentrations more 

than 100-fold higher than surrounding areas are observed, except where potential for greater 

exposure exists.  At these latter sub-areas, concentrations more than 10-fold higher than 

surrounding concentrations might be “hot spots.”  Though there were a few soil samples that 

contained elevated detections of petroleum hydrocarbons, these detections are not more than 

10-fold higher than surrounding areas. Therefore, no potential “hot spots” were identified at this 

Site. 

4.5 Estimation of Exposure Point Concentrations 

In accordance with the MCP (310 CMR 40.0926), the arithmetic mean of measured COPC 

concentrations is considered a conservative estimate of the average concentration contacted by 

potential receptors at an exposure point.  Therefore, the arithmetic mean concentrations of 

constituents detected in soil for EPH fractions, PAHs and PCBs, as described above, were 

conservatively used as the EPCs for soil exposures and for comparison to soil upper 

concentration limits (UCLs). The EPCs for VPH fractions, VOCs and metals were based upon 

the maximum detected concentrations because these constituents were analyzed in fewer 

samples. 

 

For groundwater EPCs, the maximum well-averaged concentrations were used as the EPCs for 

groundwater exposures and UCL comparison. 

4.6 Quantification of Potential Exposures 

This section describes the equations and assumptions used to evaluate potential exposure of 

identified receptors to COPCs detected at the subject Site.  The equations used to evaluate 

potential exposures in this Risk Characterization were consistent with equations presented in 

guidance developed by MADEP (1996) and USEPA (1989, 1991). 

 

The Average Daily Dose (ADD) was calculated to estimate a receptor's potential daily intake 

from exposure to constituents with potential noncarcinogenic effects.  According to MADEP 

(1996) and USEPA (1989), the exposure dose should be calculated by averaging over the 

period of time for which the receptor was assumed to be exposed.  Subsequently, the ADD for 

each compound via each route of exposure was compared to the noncarcinogenic RfD for that 

compound in order to estimate the potential noncarcinogenic hazard index due to exposure to 

that compound via that route of exposure.  

 

For constituents with potential carcinogenic effects, the lifetime average daily dose (LADD) was 

calculated to estimate potential exposures over the course of a lifetime (70 years).

Page 16 

Subsequently, the LADD for each compound via each route of exposure was multiplied by the 

cancer slope factor for that compound to estimate the potential lifetime carcinogenic risk due to 

exposure to that compound via that route of exposure. 

 

The equations used to estimate ADDs and LADDs are presented below.  The spreadsheets 

used to calculate ADDs and LADDs from these equations and parameter values are contained 

in Attachments C (on-Site resident) and D (construction/utility worker) to this report. 

4.6.1 Soil Exposure 

Exposure to soil by on-Site residents and construction/utility workers was assumed to occur via 

incidental ingestion and dermal contact.  ADDs and LADDs were calculated as follows:

EF  = Exposure Frequency (days/year) 

EP  = Exposure Period (years) 

CF  = Conversion Factor (10-6 kg/mg) 

BW  = Body Weight (kg) 

AP  = Averaging Period (days) 

4.6.2 Inhalation Exposure 

Inhalation of particulates (fugitive dust) was also evaluated for construction/utility worker 

receptors.  Exposure via inhalation of soil-derived fugitive dust is a function of the concentration 

at the source (e.g., soil), frequency and duration of contact, and a factor describing the 

concentration of a compound in respirable particles in the air.  

 

MADEP (2002a) considers that potential exposure via inhalation of dust occurs via two (2) 

uptake pathways: uptake by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract following coughing up and 

subsequent swallowing of particulates trapped by the mucosa of the upper respiratory track, and 

uptake by the respiratory system following inhalation into the lungs.  To calculate the exposure

Page 17 

associated with these two (2) uptake pathways, MADEP assumes the following for the 

maintenance and construction worker scenarios: 

 100% of respirable particulate mass (PM) is equal to or less than 30 microns in diameter 
(<=PM30) 

 40% of total respiratory particulate mass is equal to or less than 10 microns in diameter 
(<=PM10) 

 100% of inhaled particulates greater than ten (10) microns but less than or equal to thirty 
(30) microns are swallowed   

 50% of inhaled particulates equal to or less than ten (10) microns are swallowed 

 50% of inhaled particulates equal to or less than ten (10) microns enters the lungs 

 

Based on these assumptions, the effective exposure concentration of respirable particulates for 

the GI system is two (2) times the concentration of PM10, while that for the lungs is 0.5 times the 

concentration of PM10.  For the evaluation of the maintenance and construction workers, the 

concentration of PM10 in the air was assumed to be 60 ug/m
3 (MADEP, 1995; MADEP, 2002a).  

Using these effective exposure concentrations, average daily doses of COPCs for the GI and 

respiratory systems can be estimated using the following equations:

Dose-response values for inhalation exposure (i.e., unit risk factor and reference concentration) 

are expressed on a mass of compound per volume of air basis, using the assumption that a 

person weighs 70 kg and has a daily inhalation rate (Inhday) of 20 m
3.  Therefore, prior to the 

characterization of risk, ADDinhalation expressed in terms of (mg/kg-day) for the compound must 

be converted to an average daily exposure (ADEinhalation) (mg/m

with the corresponding dose-response values.  This can be accomplished using the following

4.7 Relative Absorption Factors (RAFs) 

The premise of estimating risk or hazard is that potential dose to the defined receptor is similar 

to the administered dose or applied dose in the laboratory experiment used as the basis for the 

RfD or CSF.  The animal-derived CSFs and RfDs used in the quantitative risk assessment were 

based on applied doses, in most cases.  However, the efficiency of COPC absorption via a 

particular route and from a particular matrix (e.g., soil, water) at the Site may differ from the 

absorption efficiency for the exposure route and matrix used in the experimental study that 

serves as the basis for the CSF or RfD.  RAFs are used to adjust the calculated exposure dose 

to a particulate COPC so that it is comparable to the toxicity information for that compound as 

recommended by MADEP (1996) and USEPA (1989).  RAFs for site-related COPCs were 

derived and used in the calculation of human exposure doses and are shown in Table RS-8 

(Attachment C – on-Site resident) and Tables CW-5 and CWGW-5 (Attachment D – 

construction/utility worker).  The RAFs were obtained from the MADEP recommended values 

(MADEP, 2012). 

5.0 RISK CHARACTERIZATION 

Risk characterization is the step in the risk assessment process that combines the results of the 

exposure assessment and the toxicity assessment for each COPC to estimate the potential for 

noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic human health effects from exposure to that compound.  This 

section summarizes the results of the Risk Characterization for each receptor evaluated in this 

risk assessment.  Table 5 summarizes the total noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks 

calculated for the Site.  The risk calculations, which provide results for each receptor, exposure 

pathway, and COPC, are contained in Attachments C (on-Site resident) and D 

(construction/utility worker). 

5.1 Noncarcinogenic Risk Characterization 

The potential for exposures to COPCs identified at the Site to result in adverse noncarcinogenic 

health effects was estimated for each receptor by comparing the ADD or ADE for each 

compound (derived in Section 4.6) with the RfD or RfC for that compound (presented in Section 

3.1).  The resulting ratio is known as the Hazard Quotient (HQ) for that compound.  The HQ was 

calculated using the following formula: 

 

 

 

where:  

 

HQ    = Hazard Quotient (unitless) 

ADD    = Average Daily Dose (mg/kg-day) 

RfD    = Reference Dose (mg/kg-day) 

RfD

ADD
HQ 



EnviroRisk Solutions, LLC

Page 21 

 

HQ =  ADE 

          RfC 

where:  

 

HQ    = Hazard Quotient (unitless) 

ADE    = Average Daily Exposure (mg/m3) 

RfC    = Reference Dose (mg/m3) 

 

When a HQ for a given compound does not exceed one (1), the RfD or RfC has not been 

exceeded, and no adverse noncarcinogenic health effects are expected to occur.  The HQs for 

each compound were summed to yield the Hazard Index (HI) for that pathway.  A total Hazard 

Index for a chemical was then calculated for each receptor by summing the pathway-specific 

HIs.  

 

Table 5 presents the total HIs estimated for the on-Site resident and construction/utility worker.  

A separate Method 3 Risk Characterization (EnviroRisk Solutions, 2017) was performed for a 

separate RTN (RTN 2-19975) on the eastern portion of the property related to elevated 

detections of zinc in soil and groundwater. The results of this Risk Characterization were 

conservatively added into the results of this risk characterization to show a total Site risk for both 

receptors. The calculated total subchronic and chronic HIs for each of these receptors were less 

than MADEP’s target of 1. Due to the conservative nature of assumptions used in this Method 3 

Risk Characterization, it is likely that true risks are less than those calculated. 

 

Residential exposure to homegrown produce was also calculated for informational purposes 

since this is an  unlikely pathway at the Site. As shown on Table RS-2 in Attachment C, the HIs 

calculated for residential exposure to homegrown produce were greater than the MADEP target 

of 1, due to the presence of low concentrations of PCBs in soil. Best management practices 

should be used if vegetable gardening occurs at the Site, including the use of raised beds with 

imported clean soil.

5.2 Carcinogenic Risk Characterization  

The purpose of carcinogenic risk characterization is to estimate the likelihood, over and above 

the background cancer rate, that a receptor could develop cancer in his or her lifetime as a 

result of site-related exposures to COPCs.  This likelihood is a function of the dose of a 

compound and the CSF for that compound.  The relationship between the Excess Lifetime 

Cancer Risk (ELCR) and the estimated LADD of a compound may be expressed as: 

LADDCSFe1ELCR   

where: 

 

ELCR    = Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk (unitless) 

CSF    = Cancer Slope Factor (1/(mg/kg-day)) 

LADD    = Lifetime Average Daily Dose (mg/kg-day) 

 

When the product of the CSF and the LADD is much greater than 1, the ELCR approaches 1 

(i.e., 100% probability).  When the product is less than 0.01 (1x10-2), the equation can be closely 

approximated by: 

 

LADDCSFELCR   

 

For inhalation risks, the ELCR can be calculated as: 

ELCR = UR x LADE 

where: 
 

ELCR    = Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk (unitless) 
UR     = Unit Risk (1/(µg/m3)) 
LADE    = Lifetime Average Daily Exposure (µg/m3) 

 

The product of the equation is unitless and represents an estimate of the potential carcinogenic 

risk associated with a receptor's exposure to that compound via that pathway.  ELCRs are 

calculated for each potentially carcinogenic compound.  For each receptor, the ELCRs for each 

pathway by which the receptor is assumed to be exposed is calculated by summing the 

potential risks derived for each compound.  A total ELCR is then calculated by summing the 

pathway-specific ELCRs.   

 

As with non-carcinogenic risks, the risks calculated in a separate Method 3 Risk 

Characterization (EnviroRisk Solutions, 2017) were conservatively added into the results of this 

risk characterization to show a total Site risk for both receptors. As shown in Table 5, total

Page 23 

ELCRs calculated for both hypothetical residents and construction/utility workers are less than 

the MADEP risk limit of 1E-5. 

 

Residential exposure to homegrown produce was also calculated for informational purposes 

since this is an unlikely pathway at the Site. As shown on Table RS-2 in Attachment C, the 

ELCR calculated for residential exposure to homegrown produce was greater than the MADEP 

target of 1E-5 due to the presence of low concentrations of PCBs in soil. Best management 

practices should be used if vegetable gardening occurs at the Site, including the use of raised 

beds with imported clean soil.   

5.3 Applicable or Suitably Analogous Public Health Standards 

The MCP (310 CMR 40.0993 (3)) requires an evaluation of Applicable and Suitably Analogous 

Standards (ASAS) in addition to quantitative risk assessment.  The general list of ASAS 

provided in the MCP (310 CMR 40.0993) includes the Massachusetts Drinking Water Quality 

Standards, the Massachusetts Air Quality Standards, and the Massachusetts Surface Water 

Quality Standards. 

 

Massachusetts Drinking Water Standards and Guidelines are not applicable at this Site because 

the Site is not in a drinking water area. 

 

The Massachusetts Air Quality Standards relate to ambient concentrations of the so-called 

“criteria pollutants” (sulfur oxides, particulate, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and 

lead).  The lead detected in soil was less than background concentrations in natural soil and is 

unlikely to become an air quality risk. Lead in air is typically from emissions from cars or the 

burning of landfill waste. The other criteria pollutants were not COPCs at this Site, therefore the 

Air Quality Standards are not considered to be applicable to the Site. 

 

Refer to Section 5.5 of this Risk Characterization for the Stage I Ecological Risk 

Characterization. 

5.4 Risk to Safety and Public Welfare 

In accordance with 310 CMR 40.0994, the risk of harm to safety and public welfare was 

evaluated.  No overt situations posing a threat of physical harm or bodily injury exist, nor have 

persistent odors associated with the release been reported.  Furthermore, no nuisance 

conditions or degradation of public resources have been identified or are expected.  As such, 

the Site does not pose a threat of physical harm or bodily injury, does not present a dangerous 

or nuisance condition, and does not pose a threat to any public welfare factors. 

 

As part of the public welfare evaluation, Site soil and groundwater EPCs were compared to 

UCLs as shown in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.  No soil or groundwater EPCs exceeded UCLs.

Page 24 

Based on this evaluation, a condition of No Significant Risk of harm to safety and public welfare 

exists for the Site. 

5.5 Risk to the Environment  

Risk to the Environment was evaluated in this Risk Characterization in accordance with MADEP 

guidance for Method 3 Environmental Risk Characterization (MADEP, 1996).  This MADEP 

guidance provides for two (2) stages of environmental risk characterization: 

 

 Stage I, which is used to identify those situations that require further evaluation 

 Stage II, which is a detailed evaluation of those environmental exposure pathways identified 
in Stage I 

 

For terrestrial habitats, an evaluation of habitat quality was undertaken as the first step of the 

Stage I screening, in accordance with MADEP guidance (1996).  To evaluate terrestrial habitat 

quality, available Site information was reviewed.  No Habitats of Rare Wetlands Wildlife are 

located on-site or within 500 feet of the Site.  The Site is not designated to be within a protected 

open space or an ACEC.  The Site, currently defined as being an area under the building slab 

and an area southeast of the Site building on the exterior of the building, is fully developed and, 

therefore, does not represent a potentially significant habitat, as it is less than two (2) acres.  

Additionally, impacted soil is under a building slab is unlikely to be accessible to ecological 

receptors.  As a result, the Site does not represent important habitat for terrestrial species and 

therefore, further evaluation of terrestrial habitat is not required (MADEP, 1996). 

 

A Stage I screening of aquatic habitats was performed for the Site.  Potential aquatic receptors 

in the site area include aquatic organisms in Rigby Brook situated approximately 230 feet to the 

south of the subject property, is culverted under Brook Street and the abutting 203 Brook Street 

property and then emerges approximately 390 feet to the northeast of the subject property. 

Residual concentrations of constituents in groundwater at much of the Site have been reduced 

to non-detectable levels. Only minor detections of petroleum hydrocarbons, PAHs, and metals 

have been detected in Site monitoring wells MW-10, MW-15, MW-15A, MW-15B, and MW-15C. 

The low concentrations of metals that were detected in groundwater are likely a background 

condition. 

 

To be conservative, surface water concentrations were estimated based on the maximum time-

weighted average concentrations in groundwater as shown in Table 8. A dilution factor was 

calculated based on the distance between the Site and the closest surface water body and 

applied to the maximum concentrations in groundwater. An additional dilution factor of 10 was 

applied to account for dilution of groundwater as it enters surface water. Estimated surface 

water concentrations were then compared to target surface water quality benchmarks. As 

shown in Table 8, estimated concentrations of constituents in surface water were equivalent to 

or less than target surface water quality benchmarks. Additionally, all groundwater EPCs were

less than Method 1 GW-3 groundwater standards. Based on this terrestrial and aquatic habitat 

evaluation, the Site poses No Significant Risk to the Environment, and a Stage II evaluation is 

not deemed necessary. 

 

Although groundwater within 500 feet of surface water contained detectable concentrations of 

metals that may bioaccumulate in aquatic receptors, the concentrations of dissolved metals in 

groundwater were well below Method 1 GW-3 standards, protective of aquatic receptors. 

Furthermore, the detections of metals in groundwater were not co-located with known COPCs at 

the Site and may be a background condition in groundwater in the area of the Site. On this 

basis, no further analysis of metals and the potential migration to surface water is warranted. 

 

On a separate portion of the subject property near the southeastern-most warehouse area at 

the Site, elevated concentrations of zinc were detected in groundwater above Method 1 GW-3 

groundwater standards in two monitoring wells. These detections of zinc, potential sources of 

zinc, and the potential migration of zinc to Rigby Brook were investigated in a separate Method 

3 Risk Characterization report (EnviroRisk Solutions, 2017) associated with RTN 2-19975. The 

detections of zinc in groundwater were determined to not be Site-related but were related to 

dissolved zinc in rain water and possibly zinc mobilized from the metal roof (roof run-off). Please 

refer to that report for the evaluation of elevated concentrations of zinc in groundwater on the 

eastern portion of the subject property. 

6.0 UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS 

Within any of the four (4) steps of the risk assessment process, assumptions must be made due 

to a lack of absolute scientific knowledge.  Some of the assumptions are supported by 

considerable scientific evidence, while others have less support.  Every assumption introduces 

some degree of uncertainty into the risk assessment process.  Conservative assumptions are 

made throughout the risk assessment to ensure that the health of local residents and/or 

potential receptors and the environment are protected.  Therefore, when all of the assumptions 

are combined, it is much more likely that actual risks, if any, are over-estimated rather than 

under-estimated. 

 

The assumptions that introduce the greatest amount of uncertainty in this risk assessment are 

discussed in this section. They are discussed in general terms, because for most of the 

assumptions there is not enough quantitative information to assign a numerical value that can 

be factored into the calculation of risk. 

6.1 Hazard Identification 

During the Hazard Identification step, constituents are selected for inclusion in the quantitative 

Risk Characterization. Careful consideration of all detected constituents in Site soil and 

groundwater was used to determine which constituents should be considered COPCs and

Page 26 

evaluated in the Risk Characterization. Therefore, unless constituents have been overlooked in 

the MCP protocols used for the collection of samples and analytical methodologies conducted at 

the Site, it is unlikely that exposures are under-estimated by the Hazard Identification step. 

6.2 Toxicity Assessment 

Dose-response values are usually based on limited toxicological data. For this reason, a margin 

of safety is built into estimates of both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risk, and actual risks 

may be lower than those estimated. 

 

Human dose-response values are often extrapolated, or conservatively estimated, using the 

results of animal studies. Extrapolation from animals to humans introduces a great deal of 

uncertainty in the risk assessment because in most instances, it is not known how differently a 

human may react to the chemical compared to the reaction of the animal species used to test 

the compound. The procedures used to extrapolate from animals to humans involve 

conservative assumptions and incorporate several uncertainty factors (explicit factors for 

species extrapolation, and possible sensitive populations in the case of the RfD) that are more 

likely to over-estimate than under-estimate no-effect dose in humans. 

6.3 Exposure Assessment 

During the exposure assessment, ADDs of COPCs to which receptors are potentially exposed 

are calculated, which involves assumptions about how often exposure occurs. Such 

assumptions include location, accessibility, and use of an area.  With this in mind, the receptor, 

or person who may potentially be exposed, and the location of exposure, were both defined for 

this Risk Characterization.  The locations where certain activities were assumed to take place 

have been purposely selected because chemical concentrations and frequency of exposure are 

expected to be high (i.e., use of the maximally affected areas). Since the residual soil and 

groundwater impacts associated with the hydraulic oil are located under the building slab, 

assuming residents would be exposed to hydraulic oil impacted soil from the Site is extremely 

conservative. Since residual PCB impacted soils are located on the exterior of the southeast 

corner of the building, receptors are more likely to be exposed to PCB impacted soil.  

Additionally, actual frequencies of exposure are likely to be much lower than assumed.  In these 

cases, the person's potential exposure would be reduced, and the health risks discussed here 

would be over-estimated. Receptors may be exposed to a mix of areas not containing any 

impacts, such as those areas that were excluded from the EPC calculation.  Thus, assuming 

that the receptors would be exposed to only Site media that contained the highest 

concentrations of constituents would likely over-estimate health risks.  

6.4 Risk Characterization 

The risk of adverse human health effects depends on estimated levels of exposure and on 

dose-response relationships.  Once exposure to and risk from each of the selected constituents 

is calculated, the total risk posed by exposure to Site soil is determined by combining the health

Page 27 

risk contributed by each constituent.  Where COPCs do not interact, do not affect the same 

target organ, or do not have the same mechanism of action, summing the risks for multiple 

COPCs results in an over-estimate of risk posed by the Site.  However, in order not to 

understate the risk, it is assumed that the effects of different constituents may be added 

together.  While there does exist the theoretical possibility of greater than additive effects 

(synergism) among constituents with effects on the same target organ, overall the application of 

the assumption of additivity is expected to conservatively estimate health risks. 

7.0 SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS  

A Method 3 Risk Characterization of harm to human health, public welfare, safety, and the 

environment associated with Site conditions was completed in accordance with the 

requirements of 310 CMR 40.0000 Subpart I of the MCP.  Data from Site assessment activities 

completed by Cushing, Jammallo, and Wheeler, Inc., as well as information from other sources 

(e.g., MADEP and USEPA guidance documents and databases), were used to conduct the Risk 

Characterization.  The human health Risk Characterization evaluated potential risk to on-Site 

residents and construction/utility workers assumed to be exposed to soil and construction/utility 

worker exposure to groundwater. The results of the human health Risk Characterization (see 

Table below) demonstrate that a condition of No Significant Risk of harm to human health can 

be demonstrated for current and reasonably foreseeable Site activities and uses.

The results of the evaluation of risk of harm to safety and public welfare indicate that no unsafe 

or nuisance conditions exist at the Site.  In addition, no UCL exceedances were identified.  As 

such, Site conditions pose No Significant Risk of harm to safety and public welfare under 

current and foreseeable conditions. 

 

The evaluation of potential risk of harm to the environment included an evaluation of whether 

ecological receptors were present, and whether the Site included potential important habitat for 

ecological receptors.  Because the Site is developed and is unlikely to represent a potentially 

significant habitat based on its small size and presence under the building slab, an evaluation of 

terrestrial exposures was not necessary.  Based on the concentrations of constituents detected 

in Site groundwater, the potential for the Site to impact the assumed downgradient surface 

water body, Rigby Brook, was determined to be negligible (i.e., less than ecologically-based

criteria).  Based on these findings, the Site conditions pose No Significant Risk of harm to the 

environment. 

 

The results of the Method 3 Risk Characterization of harm to human health, public welfare, 

safety, and the environment indicate that RTN 2-19956, associated with the PCB release, is 

eligible for a Permanent Solution with Conditions in accordance with the requirements 

established in 310 CMR 40.1041(2) and RTN 2-19882, associated with the hydraulic oil release, 

is eligible for a Permanent Solution with No Conditions in accordance with the requirements 

established in 310 CMR 40.1041(1). 

 

Since the estimated human health risks associated with ingestion of PCBs from soil that 

bioaccumulate into plants that are then eaten as produce were greater than non-cancer and 

cancer MassDEP risk limits, a Condition of the Permanent Solution for RTN 19956 is that Best 

Management Practices will be implemented for potential future residential gardening at the Site. 

It should be noted that the Best Management Practices (BMP) are for use of PCB-impacted Site 

soil for growing home grown produce for consumption only and in no way restricts the use of 

outdoor raised beds or any gardening activity inside or outside the facility as long as the PCB-

impacted soil is not used for produce that will be consumed. Landscaping of the PCB impacted 

area is not restricted so long as BMP are followed. The BMP only pertains to the PCB impacted 

soil that is currently located at the southwestern exterior of the site building, where the site 

building abuts Brook Street.  The use of soil brought in from a source other than the PCB 

impacted area for gardening purposes is acceptable and in no way restricted. Therefore, this 

Site as a whole is eligible for a Permanent Solution that do not require an AUL (40.1056(2)(j)(1).

Notes:

1. Surface Water Benchmarks Used as GW-3 Target Values were obtained from Development of MCP

Risk-Based Levels for Soil and Groundwater, 2014.

2. Dilution was calculated as follows:

30ft x 30ft source area, DF = 303 (distance in feet) -1.365, r2 =0.99 

The distance between the site and Rigby Brook, the closest surface water

body to the subject property.

Dilution MW-15  = 0.181 230 feet away from nearest surface water

Dilution MW-10  = 0.091 380 feet away from nearest surface water

Dilution MW-2  = 0.082 410 feet away from nearest surface water

Dilution MW-3  = 0.088 390 feet away from nearest surface water

Dilution MW-5  = 0.123 305 feet away from nearest surface water

Dilution Factor Calculation was obtained from MADEP (2002) Characterizing Risks Posed by Petroleum Contaminated

Sites:  Implementation of the MADEP VPH/EPH Approach, Final Policy, Policy #WSC-02-411, October 31. 

A second dilution factor of 100 for EPH fractions and 10 for other constituents was applied to account for additional dilution once the

groundwater enters the surface water of Rigby Brook.

Homegrown Produce Ingestion Rate

Data on mean produce ingestion rates (wet weight, ww) in the Northeast was obtained from the 1994-1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (USDA).  Data for both

genders were used for children under 6, while data for males was used for individuals 6 and older. The mean ingestion rates presented in the survey represent the arithmetic average of 

all individuals surveyed, regardless of whether or not they had consumed the produce item (e.g., an individual that did not consume the produce item was assigned a rate of 0 g/day).  To 

determine the mean ingestion rate for individuals who ate each  produce item, the ingestion rate for all individuals (consumers and nonconsumers) was divided by the percentage of 

individuals who ate the item (Table RS-7A).  These mean ingestion rates for the produce consumers were summed to determine the total produce ingestion rate for each age-group and 

converted to dry weight assuming  the produce items were all 90% water.

To convert mean ingestion rates for the age-groups studied in the survey to age-groups used in risk calculations, each age-group ingestion rate from the survey 

(i.e., 1 - 2 year olds, 3 - 5 year olds, 6 - 11 year olds, 12 - 19 year olds, and 20 - 39 year olds) was weighted according to the number of years spent in the 

risk calculation age group (i.e., 1 - 8 year olds, 8 - 15 year olds, and 15 - 31 year olds) (Table RS-7B).  It was assumed that 25% of produce ingested was home-grown (Table RS-7C).

Resident - Soil:  Table RS-9

Cyanide Calculations

The soil cyanide concentration limit set to protect a child resident against an acute, potentially lethal one-time dose of cyanide 

from incidental ingestion of contaminated soil is 100 mg/kg soil. This is the concentration of available cyanide in soil below which 

acute human health effects would not be expected following a one-time exposure.  This soil concentration is calculated using 

the equation below with a pica-type soil ingestion of 1000 mgsoil and an available cyanide dose limit of 0.01 mg/kgbody weight.

MassDEP’s guidance on evaluating the risk from a one-time cyanide dose considers cyanide’s potentially lethal effects

as well as information on cyanide metabolism:

Cyanides are detoxified rapidly by the body, and a large acute dose which overwhelms the

detoxification mechanism is potentially more toxic than the same dose distributed over a

period of hours. (MassDEP Background Documentation for the Development of an Available Cyanide Benchmark Concentration , 

originally dated October 1992, Modified August 1998)

Assessment of a potential one-time dose requires an estimate of the maximum soil concentration the receptor could contact at any one

time.  The average soil concentration within a typical exposure area will underestimate the potential one-time dose. Therefore, 

to assess the acute risk of a one-time potentially lethal dose, the EPC for cyanide should be a conservative estimate of the maximum

soil concentration. 

 

The residential soil concentration limit to protect against adverse effects from an acute (one-time) exposure to cyanide is 100 mg/kg.

Cyanide Calculations

The soil cyanide concentration limit set to protect a construction worker against an acute, potentially lethal one-time dose of cyanide 

from incidental ingestion of contaminated soil is 12,000 mg/kgsoil. This is the concentration of available cyanide in soil below which

acute human health effects would not be expected following a one-time exposure. This soil concentration is calculated using the 

equation below with a one-time soil ingestion estimate of 50 mgsoil and an available cyanide dose limit of 0.01 mg/kgbody weight.

MassDEP’s guidance on evaluating the risk from a one-time cyanide dose considers cyanide’s potentially lethal effects

as well as information on cyanide metabolism:

Cyanides are detoxified rapidly by the body, and a large acute dose which overwhelms the

detoxification mechanism is potentially more toxic than the same dose distributed over a

period of hours. (MassDEP Background Documentation for the Development of an Available Cyanide Benchmark 

Concentration,  originally dated October 1992, Modified August 1998)

Assessment of a potential one-time dose requires an estimate of the maximum soil concentration the trespasser could contact 

at any one time.  The average soil concentration within a typical exposure area will underestimate the potential one-time dose.  

Therefore, to assess the acute risk of a one-time potentially lethal dose, the EPC for cyanide should be a conservative estimate 

of the maximum concentration.  

The construction worker soil concentration limit to protect against adverse effects from an acute (one-time) exposure to cyanide is 12,000 mg/kg.

Best Management Practices for Non-commercial Gardening at Disposal Sites 

This property is part of a disposal site that has been assessed and determined to meet the 

requirements of a Permanent Solution with Conditions under the Massachusetts Contingency 

Plan (MCP), 310 CMR 40.0000, where the Conditions include the recommendation of Best 

Management Practices (“BMPs”) for gardening to reduce the potential risks from exposure to 

contaminated soil that remains on the site.  

While the property has been determined to be safe for unrestricted use, including residential 

use, there are residual levels of contaminants remaining in the soil. Gardeners should consider 

implementing BMPs to further reduce potential exposure to material in the soil, regardless of the 

contaminant levels remaining. Implementing BMPs such as those suggested below will allow 

safer gardening in a wider range of site conditions. Not every BMP is necessary for every single 

site, but a combination of BMPs appropriate for your particular site will help reduce the potential 

for additional exposure. 

Construct Physical Controls and Improve Soil Conditions  

Actions to minimize contact (covering the soil) and reduce contaminant levels (such as 

amending the soil) will further reduce potential risks. Many good gardening practices, like 

adding compost and soil amendments, improve the soil while reducing the amount of 

contaminants and exposure to them. Recommendations include: 

 Build your garden away from areas known or suspected to be contaminated. 

In addition to areas where residual contamination may be present, as 

identified by the disposal site assessment, other sources of contamination 

can include painted structures (particularly older buildings that may have 

been painted with lead paint), roads and rail lines. 

 Build a hedge or fence to reduce windblown contamination from mobile 

sources and busy streets. 

 Cover existing soil and walkways with mulch, landscape fabric, stones, or 

bricks. 

 Use mulch in your garden beds to reduce dust and soil splash back, reduce 

weed establishment, regulate soil temperature and moisture, and add 

organic matter.  

 Use soil amendments (such as lime and compost) to maintain neutral pH 

and add organic matter to improve soil structure. 



 Not all amendments are the same; be sure to choose the right 

amendments for your soil - amendments that improve conditions at one 

garden may not work well in others.  

 Keep in mind that each amendment type will have different application 

amounts and techniques (e.g., rototilling), and may need to be maintained 

and reapplied (e.g., annually). 

 Be sure to work with your local or state regulatory agency, and ask if your 

municipality provides free compost or mulch. Obtain compost only from a 

reputable source that can provide information regarding the quality and 

type of feedstock used to generate the compost.  

 Add topsoil or clean fill from a reputable source that can provide information 

regarding the quality of the topsoil or fill to ensure the soil is safe for 

handling by children or gardeners of all ages and for food production. 

 Build raised beds or container gardens. 

 Raised beds can be made by simply mounding soil into windows or by 

building containers.  

 Raised beds help improve water drainage in heavy clay soils or low-lying 

areas. They also create accessible gardening locations for many users 

and allow for more precise soil management. 

 Foot traffic should not be necessary in the bed, so the soil does not 

become compacted and soil preparation in the coming years is minimized.  

 Place a water permeable fabric cover or geotextile as the bottom layer of 

your raised bed to further reduce exposure to soils of concern.  

 Sided beds can be made from wood, synthetic wood, stone, concrete 

block, brick or naturally rot-resistant woods such as cedar and redwood. 

Avoid using chemical-treated lumber for the raised bed because 

chemicals used in the treated wood could make their way into the soils 

and plants. 

Minimize Ongoing Contact with or Ingestion of Soil  

Actions to further reduce contact with soil during and after gardening activities can also 

minimize potential risks from any contaminants remaining in the soil. 

 Do not use plants grown in contaminated soil for compost. 

 Work in the garden when soil is moist or damp to minimize creation of dust. 



 Avoid “double-digging” to decrease likelihood of moving deep soils to the 

surface. 

 Wear gloves, long sleeves and pants while gardening to prevent skin 

exposure; 

 Remove gardening shoes and garments before entering the home, and 

wash gardening clothes separately from other clothing. 

  Wash hands after gardening. 

 Wash all vegetables thoroughly.
